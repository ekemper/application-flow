Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to apply for the Technical Project Manager role. With over a decade of experience in engineering and project leadership, I bring a unique blend of technical fluency, stakeholder engagement, and Agile delivery that aligns strongly with Truelogic’s mission.

At Storyblocks, I led a multiphase initiative to launch an enterprise free trial platform. I partnered with product, design, and sales to define technical deliverables, manage timelines, and reduce risk. Acting as a de facto Scrum Master, I facilitated sprint ceremonies and helped the team achieve a 15% increase in velocity. This effort improved time-to-close on B2B contracts worth over $50K and demonstrated my ability to connect cross-functional teams and deliver measurable outcomes.

In prior roles, I’ve worked across a variety of content and CMS systems. At Sparkplug, I optimized vendor workflows via third-party integrations and relational data modeling. At Medical Solutions, I built a REST API MVP with automated testing and documentation, collaborating across QA and product teams to reduce post-release defects. Across these roles, I regularly used Jira and Confluence to manage backlogs, write tickets, and run project dashboards.

Earlier in my career, I built a scientific measurement platform while managing multi-stakeholder expectations across scientific and engineering disciplines. This experience honed my skills in stakeholder communication and technical planning—skills I’ve carried throughout my career.

I’m passionate about helping teams execute with clarity, empathy, and technical precision. I bring strong experience in SDLC practices, CMS platforms like WordPress, and Agile frameworks. I’m eager to contribute to transformative projects with a team that values cross-functional collaboration and growth.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to support your clients and drive meaningful impact.

Cheers,
Eddie Kemper
