|--------------------------------|-----------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 18/25    | The candidate showcases extensive technical skills mainly focused on software engineering.

| Relevant Experience              | 15/20    | The experience includes roles in both technical program management and software engineering, but the candidate has less direct management experience with TPMs, which is a requirement for this role. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10     | The candidate has experience in software and technical project management, but the focus seems more construction-oriented, which may not fully align with the digital and AI focus of Kohler Ventures. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10     | Communication skills seem solid, but examples could provide better specific instances of stakeholder management or cross-team alignment. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15    | There is a clear passion for technology and leadership, yet the candidate could express stronger alignment with Kohler's mission and culture. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 8/10     | The candidate mentions fostering a culture of transparency and trust, indicating a potential fit for the company's values. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 6/10     | The transition from a Senior Software Engineer to a Project Manager could be clearer, linking past experiences more explicitly to the expectations of the TPM role. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate presents a strong technical background with significant experience in software engineering and project management. Key strengths include a solid understanding of agile practices and a series of successful project examples. However, concerns arise regarding their direct management experience with teams of TPMs, and a slight misalignment in domain focus relating to AI and cloud infrastructure could hinder their fit for this role. There‚Äôs a need for better alignment with the company's mission and stronger articulation of skills that match the TPM specifics.
