| Technical Skills                    | 20/25 | The candidate exhibits a strong foundation in software engineering and technical program management, but lacks explicit mention of experience with secure client-facing technologies.                |
| Relevant Experience                  | 15/20 | While the candidate's experience as a Technical Project Manager and Senior Software Engineer shows relevant skills, there is a disconnect between job requirements for 5-7 years of TPM experience and what is presented. |
| Domain Knowledge                     | 5/10  | The candidate has experience in software engineering but lacks specific experience in finance or other relevant domains like banking, which is a focus of the job.                     |
| Communication Skills                 | 10/10 | The candidate showcases excellent communication abilities in both the resume and cover letter, emphasizing collaboration, updates to stakeholders, and clear reporting.                              |
| Motivation & Alignment               | 10/15 | The cover letter reflects excitement, but the alignment with Charles Schwab‚Äôs vision could be stronger. The candidate's entrepreneurial experience somewhat aligns with the innovative culture they seek.       |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit       | 5/10  | While the candidate shows team leadership qualities, there is less emphasis on adaptability to a fast-paced financial environment, which could raise questions about fit.                               |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment   | 6/10  | The transition from Senior Software Engineer to Technical Program Manager is present, but there's less emphasis on directly managing teams of TPMs, as required in the job description.                        |

#### üßæ Summary  

Overall, the candidate demonstrates a strong technical background with over a decade of experience in program management and software engineering, aligned with many critical skills required for the Technical Program Manager role. However, there are evident gaps in financial domain knowledge and direct management of TPM teams. While their communication abilities and proactive mindset are commendable, a more direct alignment with the job‚Äôs expectations and emphasis on relevant industry experience could significantly strengthen their application.
