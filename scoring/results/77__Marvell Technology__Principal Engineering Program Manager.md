|--------------------------------|------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 25         | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates a strong technical background but leans more towards software engineering rather than program management, which is a slight mismatch for this TPM role. Some relevant skills, like semiconductor knowledge or specific program management methodologies, are not explicitly detailed. |
| Relevant Experience             | 20         | 15/20 | The candidate has relevant experience but lacks direct experience in the semiconductor industry, which is crucial for this role. Additionally, the recent experience as a Technical Project Manager in Construction does not align closely with the technical program management focus needed. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 10         | 5/10 | Minimal evidence of domain knowledge in semiconductors; previous experiences mostly reflect software engineering rather than specific semiconductor program management. |
| Communication Skills            | 10         | 9/10 | Excellent communication skills are evident in the resume and cover letter. The candidate outlines experiences involving stakeholder collaboration and technical communication effectively. |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 15         | 10/15 | The candidate expresses a genuine interest in technical program management but does not strongly connect their motivation to the semiconductor industry or Marvell specifically. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 10         | 9/10 | There are indications of a good fit with the organizational culture, emphasizing collaboration and innovation. The emphasis on transparency and trust is a positive aspect. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10         | 5/10 | The trajectory reflects a shift toward TPM roles; however, the lack of semiconductor experience and focus on software engineering raises concerns about alignment with the role's expectations. |
