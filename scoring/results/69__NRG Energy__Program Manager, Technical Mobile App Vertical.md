#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a solid background in technical project management and software engineering with over a decade of experience. His skills in Agile practices and project delivery are notable, making him a strong contender for many technical roles. However, the lack of direct experience in mobile app development and the energy domain presents gaps for the specific needs of the Technical Program Manager position at NRG Energy. There is also a slight misalignment in demonstrating a passion for the energy industry, which is essential for cultural fit within NRG.
