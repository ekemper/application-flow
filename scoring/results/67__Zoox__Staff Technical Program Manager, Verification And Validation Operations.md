#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score    | Feedback |
|--------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| Technical Skills               | 20/25    | The candidate exhibits strong technical skills related to software engineering and project management, particularly with various technologies such as REST APIs and cloud platforms. However, there are fewer demonstrated skills specifically in verification and validation operations, which is crucial for this role. |
| Relevant Experience             | 15/20    | The candidate has relevant experience in technical project management and software engineering but lacks direct exposure to operations within an autonomous vehicle context. Additionally, while they have led technical teams, they haven't managed a team of TPMs as the job requires. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 5/10     | The candidate's experience aligns with software engineering rather than operations management in the autonomous vehicle sector. This is a gap since the role focuses on validation operations. |
| Communication Skills            | 8/10     | Strong communication skills are evident in the clear articulation of ideas and collaborative experiences listed, which would be essential for stakeholder engagements. |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 12/15    | The candidate shows great enthusiasm for technical program management and demonstrates alignment with important values such as empathy and trust, consistent with company culture, although direct alignment with automotive applications is absent. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 7/10     | The candidate highlights experience in team leadership and fostering a supportive culture, which is positive, but more direct engagement in the specific cultural aspects of Zoox may enhance their fit. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 8/10  | The candidate's trajectory reflects a transition from a technical role to a managerial one, which aligns with the growth expectations of the TPM role, but their history lacks substantial operations management experience. |
