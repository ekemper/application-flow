| Technical Skills                       | 20/25        | The candidate has a strong technical background, with expertise in software engineering, but lacks specific healthcare IT and EHR/LIS experience requested in this role.                     |
| Relevant Experience                    | 15/20        | The candidate has relevant project management experience but has limited direct handling of healthcare IT implementations, particularly those involving Cerner and Veradigm systems.           |
| Domain Knowledge                       | 5/10         | The candidate's background in healthcare appears minimal; they need experience specific to EHR/LIS conversions to meet the job requirements.                             |
| Communication Skills                   | 8/10         | The cover letter conveys good communication styles and methodologies, but could benefit from expressing more context around how those skills translate specifically to healthcare project management. |
| Motivation & Alignment                 | 12/15        | The candidate expresses a strong interest in project management and continuous improvement, but lacks a direct connection to the healthcare industry which may affect alignment.               |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit         | 6/10         | Experience in cross-functional teamwork is evident, but the absence of specific healthcare culture awareness is a drawback.                                                         |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment     | 4/10         | The candidate's transition from software engineering to project management is present but is not strongly aligned with the healthcare focus required by this position.                           |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate, Edward Kemper, exhibits strong technical skills and a solid foundation in project management, particularly in technology development and team leadership. However, the significant gap in healthcare IT experience, especially with EHR systems such as Cerner and Veradigm, is a notable shortcoming. While his communication styles and methodologies are solid, the disconnect between his background and the specific needs of this role might hinder his effectiveness. Overall, while there are promising attributes, the candidate does not fully meet the essential criteria outlined in the job description.
