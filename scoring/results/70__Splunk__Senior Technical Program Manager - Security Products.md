| Category                        | Score  | Feedback  |
|----------------------------------|--------|-----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25  | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills in software engineering, DevOps, and API development, relevant for a TPM role in a tech organization. However, some experience is more focused on engineering rather than program management, which slightly impacts the score.  |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20  | The experience listed is relevant, particularly the role of Technical Program Manager and leading agile teams. However, transitions to TPM roles lack direct program or project management experience, leading to score deductions. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10   | The candidate has relevant experience leading software projects but not specifically within security or observability domains, which are critical for this role at Splunk. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10   | Good articulation of past experiences in project management and team collaboration, but could highlight more explicit communication strategies used in critical project scenarios. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15  | The candidate effectively articulates motivations and alignment with the company's mission and culture, particularly their passion for team collaboration and problem-solving. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 6/10   | While there is an emphasis on leadership style, more could be done to align directly with Splunk‚Äôs specific cultural values such as authenticity and resilience. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 4/10   | The career trajectory shows a shift from software engineering to project management, but lacks a clear progression towards high-level TPM roles as outlined in the job description. |

#### üßæ Summary
The candidate brings a solid foundation in technical skills with extensive experience in software engineering and project management. However, there are evident gaps in experience directly aligned with the specific needs of Splunk's Senior Technical Program Manager role. There is a notable lack of experience in security products, which is integral to this position, along with less demonstrated direct program management experience. While the candidate's motivation can resonate with Splunk's mission, the overall alignment with the role's responsibilities and expectations requires improvement.
