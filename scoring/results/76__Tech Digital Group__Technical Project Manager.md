| Category                        | Score | Feedback                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                | 20/25 | The candidate shows strong technical skills in software and engineering, but the experience is heavily centered around software engineering rather than Technical Program Management (TPM). No specific mention of project management tools was noted in detail.                                         |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | The candidate has experience that somewhat aligns with the role requirements. However, the experience in insurance is notably lacking, and the TPM roles were not extensive enough to fully meet the 8 years of relevant experience requirement.                                                                                     |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | The resume lacks specific references to the insurance domain, which is crucial for this role. While the candidate has solid technical experience in software engineering, it does not relate directly to the required industry domains expressed in the job posting.                                                                            |
| Communication Skills            | 8/10  | The cover letter demonstrates strong communication skills and includes relevant examples; however, there could be more emphasis on stakeholder engagement and consultative approaches that are necessary for a TPM in a matrixed environment.                                                                                       |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15 | The candidate expresses motivation for the role and connects past experiences to the position. However, the lack of domain-specific passion or articulation regarding their fit for the insurance industry limits the enthusiasm expressed in alignment with organizational goals.                                   |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 7/10  | The candidate mentions fostering psychological safety and collaboration, which aligns with common organizational values. More evidence of adaptability to different cultures, particularly in the insurance domain, could enhance this score.                                                                                          |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 6/10  | Though the candidate has a strong technical background, the shift from software engineering to program management is not as explicitly articulated. More clarity on how specific experiences will transfer to the TPM role is needed.                                                                                                              |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper demonstrates a robust technical background and relevant leadership experience, giving him a solid foundation for the Technical Project Manager role. However, the lack of direct experience in the insurance domain raises concerns about alignment with the specific requirements of the position. The candidate's communication skills and project management principles are strong, but it's important to see a deeper connection to the program's deliverables and responsibilities related to leading complex projects in this specific industry.
