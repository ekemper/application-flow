| Technical Skills                            | 15/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills in software engineering and project management.

| Relevant Experience                         | 10/20 | While the candidate has leadership experience in tech roles, the role requires specific experience in property condition assessments and construction management, which the candidate does not explicitly demonstrate. |

| Communication Skills                        | 7/10  | The candidate displays good communication skills in the cover letter; however, specific experience with technical report writing and interpersonal communication in construction settings needs more emphasis. |

| Cultural or Organizational Fit              | 5/10  | The cover letter reflects a positive mindset and mentions collaboration, yet it doesn't address the specific company culture and values detailed in the job description. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment         | 5/10  | The transition from software engineering and program management to building assessments is not clearly carved out. More emphasis should be placed on skills transferable to a construction project management role. |
