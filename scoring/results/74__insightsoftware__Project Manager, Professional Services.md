### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate has strong technical skills, particularly in software development, which is beneficial for program management in technical environments. However, the skills listed may lean too heavily towards software development rather than the requirement for managing technical programs which combines more overarching leadership aspects. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | The candidate has relevant experience in software development and project management, but lacks firm grounding in financial planning and analysis which is essential for this role. Additionally, experience working within a professional services department is not explicitly demonstrated. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | The candidate has general experience in technology but lacks specific expertise in financial planning and analysis or corporate performance management technology as required by the job description. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | Communication abilities are highlighted in the coverage of leadership style and project management methodologies. However, further specifics on stakeholder engagement could enhance this section. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15 | The candidate expresses passion for the role and company values but lacks direct connection to the impact on business operations and finance, which detracts from alignment to the specific role's expectations. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 6/10  | The candidate demonstrates a focus on fostering psychological safety and collaboration within teams. However, illustrating experience in a high-performance culture or specific examples of driving performance within a professional services environment is missing. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10/10 | The evolution of the candidate‚Äôs career towards technical management roles aligns well with the job's expectations. Commitment to continual growth is clear and well-presented. |
