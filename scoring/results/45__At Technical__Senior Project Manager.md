#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a solid background in technical project management and software engineering, but there are significant gaps in civil engineering experience, which is essential for the Senior Project Manager role. Their technical skills and communication abilities are noteworthy, but the lack of relevant domain knowledge and specific experience managing civil engineering projects make them an unsuitable fit for this particular position. Overall, while the candidate demonstrates leadership qualities and strong project management experience, the mismatch between their background and the job requirements is a major concern.
