|----------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate possesses a strong foundation in technical skills, particularly in software development and program management. However, the role necessitates a background more directly related to Logistics or Supply Chain, which is somewhat lacking. |
| Relevant Experience              | 12/20 | While the candidate has substantial experience in software engineering and project management, their recent roles are heavily focused on technical initiatives rather than directly relevant projects in logistics or supply chain management which could be beneficial for this position. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | The candidate lacks explicit experience in the Supply Chain or Logistics sectors, which is a key preference for this position. This could impede their ability to fully engage with the role‚Äôs requirements. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | Demonstrated strong communication abilities in past roles with evidence of interfacing with stakeholders and delivering project updates effectively. Room for improvement exists in showcasing specific instances of presentations to C-suite executives as required by the job description. |
