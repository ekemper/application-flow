|----------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 15/25 | The candidate has a strong foundation in technical skills, particularly in software engineering. However, their emphasis on development rather than project management methodologies relevant to the job description resulted in a lower score. |
| Relevant Experience              | 10/20 | Candidate has relevant experience as a Technical Program Manager and Senior Software Engineer, but lacks specific construction project management experience, which is crucial for this role. Additionally, they have not directly managed construction projects valued at $500K+. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | Experience in software engineering and program management is strong, but the candidate lacks specific experience in the construction domain or nuclear industry, which are vital for the role. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | The candidate demonstrates solid communication skills both in their application materials and through past role descriptions, particularly in stakeholder management and team alignment. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 5/15  | Although the candidate expresses enthusiasm for project management, their background is heavily skewed towards software engineering, lacking alignment with the construction management focus of the role. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 2/10  | Limited exposure to the cultural values of a construction environment leads to a lower fit rating. While they mention leadership qualities, there‚Äôs little evidence of cultural alignment with a nuclear facility context. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 0/10  | The candidate has not progressed in a construction management career, and there‚Äôs no substantial evidence of managing construction teams or projects, which is essential for this position. |
