| Category                        | Score    | Feedback                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills               | 20/25    | The candidate displays strong technical skills, particularly in software development and project management. However, the experience with specific tools such as Python and Excel, which are preferred, is only mentioned in passing.                          |
| Relevant Experience             | 15/20    | The candidate has over 11 years of experience. However, their role as a Technical Project Manager primarily in a construction context isn't directly transferable to a tech-centric role, which affects the score.                     |
| Domain Knowledge                | 5/10     | Experience in technology is present, but the candidate lacks direct experience in MarTech or marketing operations, which is critical for this role.                             |
| Communication Skills            | 8/10     | Strong communication is evidenced through the candidate's leadership roles and cover letters that articulate clarity and strategy well.                                       |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15    | The motivation to join a tech company like Meta is implied but could be more explicit in terms of alignment with the company's mission and values.                      |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 8/10     | The candidate‚Äôs emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and nurturing a positive work culture aligns well with Meta‚Äôs values but may lack certain aspects of navigating ambiguity stated in the job description.                   |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 8/10 | The candidate's trajectory demonstrates growth into leadership roles, but they need to emphasize their transferable skills better for a seamless switch from software engineering to TPM.                                 |
