|--------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate displays a strong technical background with various skills in software development and project management. However, the role emphasizes Agile delivery, which could be more explicitly highlighted. |

| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10 | The candidate's progression shows experience in roles leading to project management; still, the transition from engineering to management could be emphasized further. |

However, there are concerns regarding the relevance of some past roles, particularly his recent position in construction that may not correlate well with technical solution delivery in consulting. Additionally, while his communication skills shine through, greater emphasis on specific Agile experience and direct alignment to Slalom's consulting values could enhance his candidacy.
