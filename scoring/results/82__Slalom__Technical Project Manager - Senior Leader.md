| Technical Skills                 | 20/25   | The candidate demonstrates a strong technical skill set, particularly in software development and project management tools (e.g. AWS, Agile methodologies). A minor deduction is due to a possible over-emphasis on engineering versus project management experience. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20   | The candidate has relevant experience in technical project management but has not been in a consulting role recently. This affects alignment with the job‚Äôs requirements. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 8/10    | Familiarity with the software industry and project delivery methodologies is demonstrated, aligning well with the company's needs.                                               |
| Communication Skills             | 10/10   | The communication skills, both written and verbal, are well-articulated in the resume and cover letter. Strong demonstration of stakeholder engagements through examples provided. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15   | Displays a clear motivation for the role and alignment with the company‚Äôs mission, though more specifics on why this particular company appeals to him could strengthen the case. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 6/10    | Evidence of inclusive leadership and team dynamics, but more specific examples related to DEI initiatives could enhance this score further.                                      |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 5/10   | The candidate's previous roles transition into project management well; however, lacking extensive consulting experience may create a misalignment with the job expectations. |
