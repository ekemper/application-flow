|----------------------------------|---------|------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25   | 25         | Candidate demonstrates a strong software engineering background but lacks a clear established proficiency in key aspects of web marketing and technical program management specific to this role, such as CMS usage and digital accessibility standards. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20   | 20         | The candidate has extensive experience managing teams and projects, though most roles focus heavily on software engineering, which may not align directly with a web marketing manager position. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10    | 10         | Limited exposure to web marketing and technical SEO knowledge, which are significant requirements for the role. Experience primarily in software engineering doesn‚Äôt fully cover marketing contexts. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10    | 10         | Evidence of strong communication and stakeholder management skills, particularly in leading project updates and cross-team alignment; however, more focus on marketing communication would strengthen this area. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15   | 15         | High level of enthusiasm for contributing positively to teams, but more emphasis on the fit for this specific web marketing role would be beneficial. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10    | 10         | Candidate has high-level values such as teamwork and empathy, aligning with organizational culture; however, specific company fit for a marketing-driven approach is less evident. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10  | 10         | Transitioning focus from engineering to program management is promising but requires clearer articulation of direct relevance to web initiatives and technical marketing projects. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper has a solid background in technical program management with over 11 years of experience in software engineering and project management, demonstrating a record of leading cross-functional teams and delivering complex solutions. However, the candidate's experience heavily favors engineering over web marketing, which may hinder alignment with the specific needs outlined in the job description, particularly concerning technical SEO, CMS management, and digital accessibility. While his communication and leadership skills are strong, there is room for improvement in conveying a clearer fit for this type of technical marketing role.
