|---------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 18/25  | The candidate possesses a strong technical background as a Senior Software Engineer and has experience with managing software projects. However, the specific mention of Microsoft D365 CRM and website development was absent, which is critical for this role. |
| Relevant Experience             | 12/20  |  The candidate has experience in project management and software engineering, but the work is not sufficiently aligned with the required 5 years of experience in managing Microsoft D365 CRM product delivery, which significantly impacts their score. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 6/10   | The candidate has experience in software development and project management but lacks specific knowledge or experience related to the government and non-profit sectors, which is crucial for this role at Sylogist. |
| Communication Skills            | 7/10   | Strong communication skills were illustrated in the cover letter, particularly around stakeholder engagement. However, a more concrete example related to the required Microsoft D365 CRM role could strengthen this further. |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 8/15   | There is a clear motivation reflected towards technical leadership; however, the alignment with the specific responsibilities and mission of Sylogist could be articulated more effectively. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 8/10   | The narrative does reflect a good understanding of collaborative team environments. Highlighting how these experiences correlate with Sylogist‚Äôs values could enhance this category. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 8/10 | The candidate has a multifaceted background but could enhance clarity on the alignment of their project management trajectory toward the type of projects Sylogist focuses on. |

#### üßæ Summary

Overall, the candidate has a robust technical background with extensive project management experience. However, there are notable gaps in their experience regarding specific technologies (MS D365 CRM) required for the role and a lack of experience in the targeted domain of government or non-profit sectors. While the candidate's communication skills appear strong, the alignment of their motivation with Sylogist‚Äôs mission could be more compelling. Specific experience in regulated environments is also a concern.
