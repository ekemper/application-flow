| Technical Skills               | 20/25  | 25         | The candidate demonstrates a strong technical foundation with extensive software engineering skills but leans heavily towards engineering rather than program management.               |

| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 8/10   | 10         | The candidate‚Äôs career trajectory shows a good progression towards managerial roles, but recent experiences are more technical than strategic.                                           |
