| Technical Skills                   | 20/25  | The candidate demonstrates a strong technical background in software engineering and program management, but lacks depth in specific cloud services or technologies relevant to AWS. |

| Domain Knowledge                    | 5/10   | Experience in the cloud domain is insufficiently covered; roles are primarily software engineering, and there is limited mention of security clearance and AWS-specific knowledge.   |
| Communication Skills                | 8/10   | Strong written communication is evident in the cover letter, showcasing the ability to articulate complex ideas clearly. However, it could be more tailored towards cross-functional stakeholder engagement. |
| Motivation & Alignment              | 10/15  | Demonstrates a good alignment with the role's mission and the importance of innovation; however, more focus on the specific AWS culture would strengthen this aspect.                         |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit      | 5/10   | The cover letter touches on experience fostering a team culture but makes limited reference to AWS‚Äôs specific values and DEI initiatives.                                                              |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment  | 7/10   | While there is a clear career trajectory moving towards program management, the transition from software engineering needs greater emphasis concerning the responsibilities of a TPM role. |
