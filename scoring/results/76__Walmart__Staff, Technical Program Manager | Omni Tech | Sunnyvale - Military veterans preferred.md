#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|--------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates substantial technical proficiency in software development, API integration, and infrastructure, which is relevant for a Technical Program Manager. However, points were deducted for a lack of explicit Agile project management tool experience (like JIRA or Confluence) being mentioned directly in the context of TPM roles.|
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | The candidate has extensive experience with software engineering and some project management roles. However, the experience as a Technical Project Manager in Construction may not align perfectly with the required software/application development focus.|
| Domain Knowledge                 | 7/10  | A solid background in software development and program management is evident, but there's limited direct experience in large-scale software/application management, which is a critical requirement for this position.|
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | The cover letter showcases effective communication and engagement in cross-functional teams. However, clarity could be improved on communicating project commitments and status updates.|
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15 | While the cover letter demonstrates enthusiasm and a cultural fit for the role, it lacks specificity regarding how past experiences directly align with Walmart's mission and values.|
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10  | The candidate expresses a leadership style built on empathy and transparency, which resonates well. However, further specific examples tying their experience to Walmart's stated culture and mission would bolster this.|
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 6/10 | The candidate's career progression is notable, but they have less direct experience in technical program management than the role requires. Clearer alignment with the job title would improve this score.|
