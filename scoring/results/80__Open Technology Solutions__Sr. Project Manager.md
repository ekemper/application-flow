#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|--------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 22/25 | The candidate demonstrates a strong background in software development and program management, particularly in employing various technical skills relevant to the role. The candidate's resume includes a comprehensive skill set covering SDLC, Agile methodologies, and software engineering technologies, which aligns well with the requirements. A minor deduction for less emphasis on project management tools specifically. |
| Relevant Experience              | 17/20 | The candidate has extensive experience in technical roles that involve project and program management, with notable leadership in their current and previous positions. However, they lack direct experience managing other TPMs, which is a requirement in the job description. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 8/10  | The candidate has applicable experience in technology project management and has worked in environments requiring technical collaboration, although direct experience in financial or CRM projects would be beneficial. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | The candidate's communication skills are displayed through their collaborative work across teams and their experience promoting transparency. A more explicit mention of various communication strategies could command a higher score. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15 | The candidate articulates clear motivations and aligns well with the team's values and responsibilities detailed in the job description. They express a consistent drive for improvement and team collaboration but could better illustrate how their vision aligns with the specific organization's goals. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 9/10  | The candidate's emphasis on empathy, trust, and championing growth resonates well with cultural expectations for this role. Their leadership background suggests an alignment with the organizational culture, although further examples could solidify this fit. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 4/10  | While the candidate has a strong technology background, they haven't clearly outlined their transition from technical roles to TPM specifically. More focus on their career trajectory toward program management would help improve this score. |
