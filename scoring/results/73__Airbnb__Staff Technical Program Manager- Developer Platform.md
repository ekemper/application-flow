#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score      | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25      | The candidate exhibits a robust technical background in software engineering, with experience in multiple relevant technologies (Node.js, AWS, Python). However, some of their recent roles lean heavily into software engineering rather than program management, which slightly detracts from their TP management skills. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20      | The candidate demonstrates relevant experience as a manager and in software projects, but their recent role as a Technical Project Manager in Construction is not directly applicable to the requirements of a Technical Program Manager in a tech environment. This distance impacts overall relevance. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10       | The candidate lacks direct experience in cloud-hosted web applications and large-scale roll-outs, which is essential for this role in a developer platform context. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10       | The cover letter articulates enthusiasm clearly and showcases communication abilities well, although it could benefit from more specific alignment to the job description. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15      | The candidate expresses genuine interest in the role but does not clearly connect their past experiences or stated motivations with Airbnb‚Äôs mission or the specific challenges of the TPM position. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10       | While mentioning a collaborative and empathetic team environment is positive, there is little direct reference to Airbnb's cultural emphasis on inclusion and belonging. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10/10       | The transition from a software engineering focus to a TPM aligns well with common career paths, showing an evolution in leadership and responsibility. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper comes with a commendable decade-long background in both software engineering and technical project management. His strong communication skills, combined with an evident passion for technology and team collaboration, are notable strengths. However, there are significant gaps concerning direct experience with cloud environments and large-scale project roll-outs. His recent work experiences also lean toward construction and manual project management rather than the technical aspects highlighted in the Airbnb job. Furthermore, while the candidate demonstrates leadership and responsibility, a clearer alignment with Airbnb's cultural ethos and the specific role responsibilities is needed.
