#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper shows a solid technical foundation and a decade of experience in software engineering and project management. However, the application does not reflect the specific security focus nor the requisite knowledge of Oracle products essential for the role. Additionally, direct experience in leading teams through security initiatives is not adequately highlighted. There appears to be a gap in both domain-specific knowledge and project alignment with the expectations outlined in the job description.
