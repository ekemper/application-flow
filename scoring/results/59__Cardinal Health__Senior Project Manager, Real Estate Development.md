| Technical Skills                | 15/25  | The candidate has a strong technical background, especially in software engineering, but lacks experience in construction project management and the specific skills highlighted in the job description, such as AutoCAD.          |
| Relevant Experience             | 10/20  | The candidate's experience is primarily in software engineering and may not align with the construction and real estate development focus of the job. Limited direct management of real estate projects is a concern.               |
| Domain Knowledge                | 5/10   | The candidate's experience in real estate development is minimal; most roles are tech-focused, which does not directly correlate with the demands of this position in real estate management.                                   |
| Communication Skills            | 8/10   | The candidate communicates well in their application materials, but lacks direct examples showcasing presentation skills as required.                                                                                             |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15  | The applicant expresses enthusiasm for the role but does not sufficiently link their background to the specific role at Cardinal Health.                                                                                       |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 6/10   | While the candidate shows intent to foster collaboration and a positive work culture, there is less focus on the specific organizational culture of Cardinal Health, which values diversity and collaboration across disciplines.  |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 5/10   | The candidate has transitioned into project management from engineering but lacks long-term alignment with real estate and construction roles as this job entails.                                                                  |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper has a solid technical foundation and experience in software engineering along with some project management in technical domains. However, his experience does not align well with the needs for a Senior Project Manager in Real Estate Development, primarily as he lacks direct experience in construction project management and a strong understanding of real estate domains and associated regulations. The candidate needs to demonstrate more relevant project management experiences in the construction or real estate sectors to strengthen his application for this particular position.
