#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|---------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 20/25 | The candidate possesses a strong technical background with skills in various programming languages and cloud technologies. However, there is no explicit mention of Oracle projects or ERP systems, which are critical to the role. |
| Relevant Experience             | 10/20 | The candidate has experience in software engineering and technical project management but lacks the specific ERP and Procurement project management experience requested in the job description. Their experience in construction project management also does not align well with the position requirements. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 5/10  | While the candidate has managed project teams and technical execution, there is no apparent background in ERP systems or financial technology, which are central to the role. |
| Communication Skills            | 8/10  | The candidate demonstrates strong communication and leadership capabilities within their previous roles, effectively conveying project statuses and coordinating across teams, particularly in the cover letter. |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15 | The motivation for the role is strong, but they do not sufficiently connect their career trajectory from software engineering to technical project management in a way that directly correlates with the job's specifics. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 5/10  | There is a general alignment with DEI values in the cover letter, but the candidate needs to specify a more concrete alignment with the company‚Äôs stated mission and values. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10  | The trajectory demonstrates growth from engineering to project management, but the leap to an ERP-focused role could raise concerns about fit without direct experience in the specific domain. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate possesses a robust technical background and valuable project management experience in a variety of technical roles.
