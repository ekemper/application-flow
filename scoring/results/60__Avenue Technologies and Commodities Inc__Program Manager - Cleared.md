| Category                        | Score | Max Points | Feedback |
|--------------------------------|-------|------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 15    | 25         | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills in software engineering and project management. However, there‚Äôs a lack of emphasis on specific technologies related to the aerospace industry, as well as project management methodologies like Earned Value Management System (EVMS) essential for the role. |
| Relevant Experience              | 10    | 20         | The experience listed includes relevant technical roles, but there is insufficient evidence of direct program management in a regulated industry or specific aerospace experience, which is a key requirement. Additionally, while the candidate has technical project management experience, leading cross-functional teams in alignment with aerospace standards is limited. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5     | 10         | The candidate lacks experience in aerospace certification standards or relevant regulations, which is a critical component of the job. |
| Communication Skills             | 8     | 10         | Communication skills are adequately shown in the cover letter and experiences. The candidate effectively conveys their management style and experience in team dynamics. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10    | 15         | The candidate expresses enthusiasm for the role and mentions team dynamics. However, there could be more specific alignment with the company's mission and the impact of the role on the organization‚Äôs goals. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5     | 10         | The candidate mentions fostering a collaborative team environment, but there is limited demonstration of understanding how their style aligns with the company culture focused on military and aerospace standards. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7     | 10         | While there is career growth and a journey from software engineering to program management, clearer connections to this specific role's responsibilities and industry requirements are missing. |
