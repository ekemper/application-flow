#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a well-rounded application with a strong technical foundation and extensive experience in software engineering and project management. His leadership style emphasizes collaboration and psychological safety, which aligns well with Procore‚Äôs cultural values. However, the absence of a direct focus on cybersecurity initiatives and the limited demonstration of relevant program management experience in the domain may hinder his fit for this specific Technical Program Manager role. Overall, he shows promise but needs to refine his narrative to better tailor it to the cybersecurity aspect of the position.
