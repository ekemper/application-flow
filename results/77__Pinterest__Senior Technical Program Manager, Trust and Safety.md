#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Max Points | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|-------|------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 18    | 25         | The candidate has a solid understanding of software engineering principles but leans heavily on engineering experience rather than specific program management skills needed for a TPM role. Some familiarity with SQL and scripting is mentioned but lacks depth in program management tools and methodologies. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15    | 20         | The candidate has relevant PM experience as well as strong leadership skills but lacks a robust track record in managing program-specific initiatives directly relevant to Trust and Safety roles. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5     | 10         | While the candidate has worked in software engineering and development, they do not mention any prior experience in Trust and Safety, which is a noted preference in the job description. |
| Communication Skills             | 8     | 10         | The candidate demonstrates strong communication skills in their cover letter and resume, highlighting collaborative projects effectively. A slight reduction due to lack of direct mention of storytelling with data to executive stakeholders. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10    | 15         | The cover letter expresses a strong alignment with Pinterest‚Äôs mission and culture. Minor penalties due to vagueness in personal motivating factors relating to a specific position within the Trust and Safety context. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 8     | 10         | The candidate articulates a strong preference for a collaborative, empathic work environment, which aligns well with Pinterest‚Äôs culture. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 13    | 10         | The candidate‚Äôs background in engineering and management roles aligns well with the job‚Äôs requirements but there is a minor gap in explicit TPM career trajectory. |

Edward Kemper presents a strong technical background with over a decade of experience in managing cross-functional teams and delivering software solutions. His experience in presenting ideas, team leadership, and agile methodologies stands out as significant strengths. However, there are notable gaps in direct experience related to Trust and Safety, as well as specific TPM frameworks and tools.
