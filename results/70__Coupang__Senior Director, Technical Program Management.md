|--------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25   | The candidate displays solid technical expertise and a broad range of skills relevant to program management but leans heavily on engineering experience, which is not directly aligned with the job requirement for managing a TPM team. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20   | While the candidate has significant experience in software engineering and project management, the roles involve managing technical projects rather than direct experience managing TPMs, leading to a deduction. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10    | The candidate has worked in engineering and technical roles but lacks specific experience in e-commerce or infrastructure platforms, which is critical for this position at Coupang. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10    | The candidate demonstrates strong communication skills in the cover letter and resume; however, some sentences could be clearer. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15   | The candidate expresses motivation well, but the alignment with Coupang's specific needs in e-commerce infrastructure isn't fully established. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10    | The candidate's experience suggests a fit for agile environments, but specifics about culture and values at Coupang are not addressed clearly. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10    | The candidate's trajectory shows growth in technical roles, but there is insufficient evidence to prove alignment with a senior TPM role. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate has a strong technical foundation and considerable experience in software engineering and project management. However, gaps in specific experience leading a team of TPMs and familiarity with e-commerce infrastructure can weaken the fit for this senior role. The candidate demonstrates a commitment to project success and team alignment, but without explicit evidence of leading technical programs, especially in the required domains, their suitability for the role is uncertain.

#### üí° Suggestions

**Resume Bullet Updates**  
1. **Update**: Replace ‚ÄúManaged and coordinated meetings with subcontractors‚Äù with ‚ÄúLed cross-functional team meetings to align engineering and infrastructure efforts, ensuring adherence to project milestones.‚Äù
   - **Rationale**: This phrasing emphasizes leadership and cross-functional collaboration, aligning better with the role's expectations.
   
2. **Update**: In the ‚ÄúTechnical Program Manager‚Äù section, add ‚ÄúMentored junior team members and interns in program management practices and core technical skills.‚Äù
   - **Rationale**: This addition highlights relevant management experience, showing the ability to grow and lead a team of TPMs.

**Cover Letter Updates**  
1. **Update**: "I believe I have the right combination of deep technical experience and leadership experience to make a positive impact" to "I am confident my deep technical experience along with my ambition to lead and develop high-performing Technical Program Managers aligns with Coupang's mission."
