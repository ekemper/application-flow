| Technical Skills                 | 20/25      | The candidate has strong technical skills with experience in software engineering and project management, but the resume leans heavily on software engineering rather than TPM-specific experience. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20      | While there is relevant experience as a Technical Project Manager, the candidate's experience managing a team of TPMs is unclear, potentially detracting from alignment with this role's requirements. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 8/10       | The candidate has experience in various domains, including engineering and software development, but lacks specific mention of project administration, which is crucial for this role. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10       | The cover letter reflects a good command of communication, particularly in conveying leadership and team collaboration. Good examples are provided. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15      | The candidate shows clear motivation and alignment with the goals of the hiring company and the role, particularly regarding leadership and team dynamics. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10       | The candidate references teamwork and leadership, but lacks specific mentions of cultural values that the organization emphasizes, such as DEI initiatives. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 4/10     | The transition from software engineering to technical program management lacks clarity in the narrative. More emphasis on alignment with the TPM role would improve this score. |
