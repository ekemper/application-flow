| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | 25         | The candidate has a strong technical background with ample experience in software engineering and project management. However, the resume leans more towards engineering than project management, which could be more tailored to the role of a Technical Program Manager. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | 20         | The candidate has relevant experience in managing projects and teams. However, specific experience related to data center construction and infrastructure, as mentioned in the job description, is missing. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | 10         | The candidate has solid knowledge in software engineering but lacks specific knowledge or experience in data center design or construction which is crucial for the role. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | 10         | The candidate communicates well, particularly in their cover letter. Their experience in stakeholder communication is evident and well-articulated. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15 | 15         | The candidate effectively expresses motivation through their experiences but could make stronger connections between their past roles and the mission of Oracle. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10  | 10         | The resume indicates experience working in collaborative environments, but doesn‚Äôt highlight adaptability to Oracle's corporate culture or its values. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 0/10 | 10         | The lack of direct experience in technical program management or managing data centers results in a complete deduction in this area. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate, Edward Kemper, demonstrates a solid track record in technical roles, particularly in software engineering. However, they have gaps in experience specifically relevant to data center management and infrastructure, which are critical for the role of Principal Technical Program Manager at Oracle. There's a good indication of leadership skills and communication abilities, yet the lack of focus on program management hinders alignment with the job requirements. Additionally, the trajectory towards explicit program management roles appears to be missing.
