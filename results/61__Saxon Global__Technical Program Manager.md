|--------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 10/25 | The candidate possesses experience with software engineering and some leadership experience.

| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10  | The candidate mentions values such as empathy and underlines the importance of trust within teams. However, without explicit experience in the organization's technical environment, some points are deducted. |
