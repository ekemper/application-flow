| Technical Skills                   | 20/25               | The candidate showcases a broad range of technical skills relevant to software development but lacks a strong emphasis on project management methodologies and tools specific to the role.                                                                 |
| Relevant Experience                  | 15/20               | While the candidate has extensive experience in software engineering, the specific project management experience may not fully align with the 3-5 years of PM experience required, leading to a deduction.                                                        |
| Domain Knowledge                    | 5/10                | The candidate demonstrates relevant domains such as software engineering but lacks direct telco experience and specific PM certifications like PMP indicated in the job description.                                                                                       |
| Communication Skills                | 10/10               | Excellent communication skills are demonstrated in the cover letter and resume, with clear articulation of past responsibilities and outcomes.                                                                                                   |
| Motivation & Alignment              | 10/15               | The cover letter conveys enthusiasm for the role, yet the alignment with the company culture and values could be made more explicit to strengthen the motivation for the specific position.                                                       |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit      | 5/10                | The candidate references leadership and team collaboration well, but lacks direct references to the cultural alignment or specific values mentioned in the job description, such as relationship building and analytical skills.                                |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 2/10                | There‚Äôs a noted gap between the candidate's experience and the specific requirements of this more junior PM role; the experience appears too senior and may not fit with the junior focus of the position.                    |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper has a strong technical background with over a decade of leadership in software engineering and some experience in project management. However, there seems to be a mismatch regarding the required level of PM experience for this Technical Project Manager role, which is more entry-level compared to his extensive background. The cover letter effectively communicates his skills and passion, but it could benefit from better alignment with the specific demands of the role. Notably, the lack of direct telco experience and the focus on software engineering rather than PM could raise concerns.
