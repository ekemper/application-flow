|---------------------------------|-------|------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 20/25 | 25         | The candidate has strong technical skills, particularly in software development and project management tools like JIRA and Confluence, which are relevant to the role. However, less focus on agile practices and methodologies impacted the score. |
| Relevant Experience             | 15/20 | 20         | The candidate has extensive experience in technical project management and software engineering, but their recent title as a Technical Project Manager in construction might not align perfectly with the tech industry context that Under Armour seeks. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 5/10  | 10         | The candidate lacks specific domain experience related to digital and physical retail, which is vital for this role at Under Armour. |

| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15 | 15         | The cover letter reflects a genuine interest in the role and Under Armour's mission but could better convey a passion for sports or fitness, which is emphasized in the job description. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 5/10  | 10         | While the candidate shows awareness of cohesive team integration, the connection to Under Armour's specific values like "Stand for Equality" is not evident throughout their materials. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 13/10 | 10 | The candidate‚Äôs background in project management and engineering shows a progressive trajectory that aligns well with a Technical Project Manager role, although a bit more focus on direct digital product experience could enhance the fit. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper showcases a solid technical background and a commendable amount of experience in engineering and project management, which are critical strengths. However, there are concerns regarding specific domain knowledge related to the retail industry and a lack of particular emphasis on Under Armour‚Äôs unique culture. The cover letter does present motivations that align with the company, but further articulation of passion for the sports sector could strengthen alignment with the role.
