#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills, especially in software engineering and system design. However, while they have experience, they could highlight more specific project management tools relevant to this role, like Jira and Confluence. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | The candidate has varied experience, especially at Storyblocks and as a Technical Program Manager, which aligns well. However, they need to emphasize roles that match the depth required (10+ years) in TPM that includes cloud platform experience. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 7/10  | The candidate has relevant domain knowledge, particularly in APIs and software engineering. They should strengthen their cloud integration experience, which is a core requirement in the job description. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | Strong communication skills are evident in both the resume and cover letter. They've successfully articulated their project experiences, but a more structured approach could improve clarity. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15 | The motivation to transition to a Technical Program Manager is clear, and the alignment with the company's mission is present. However, more emphasis on how past experiences directly correlate with the new TPM roles could enhance this score. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 6/10  | The applicant emphasizes collaboration and leadership, but explicit references to DEI initiatives or cultural alignment with ADT could enhance the overall fit. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10/10| The career trajectory shows growth from engineering to TPM roles, aligning well with the PM role's requirements. |
