|--------------------------------|---------|----------|
| Technical Skills               | 15/25   | The candidate has strong technical skills in software engineering, which is relevant; however, those skills are too heavily focused on engineering rather than program management, which is necessary for this role. |
| Relevant Experience             | 12/20   | While the candidate has experience as a Technical Project Manager and Software Engineer, their experience does not clearly align with the specific legal, contract management and negotiation aspects outlined in the job description. |

| Communication Skills            | 8/10    | The cover letter and experience highlight good interpersonal and communication skills. However, more specific examples of negotiating contracts would strengthen this category. |
