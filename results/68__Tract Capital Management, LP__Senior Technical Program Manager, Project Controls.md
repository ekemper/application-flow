|--------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills               | 20/25  | The candidate demonstrated strong technical skills in software engineering and project management. However, they lack specific experience with construction management software and metrics as specified in the job description, which is a crucial aspect of this role.                             |
| Relevant Experience             | 15/20  | The candidate has significant experience in technical project management and software engineering, but their experience primarily focuses on software rather than the physical infrastructure delivery which is critical for this position.                                                      |
| Domain Knowledge                | 5/10   | The candidate has limited exposure to data center operations or infrastructure projects, which are key components of the job. While they have managed projects, they haven't specifically referenced experience in the data center industry.                                                      |
| Communication Skills            | 10/10  | Strong communication skills were evident in both the resume and cover letter, with clear examples of leadership and facilitation efforts. The candidate excels at stakeholder communication and managing team dynamics.                                                                          |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15  | The candidate shows motivation for the role, but their cover letter could benefit from stronger alignment with the data center industry and specific responsibilities related to project controls stated in the job description.                                                                    |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 5/10   | While the emphasis on fostering a positive team culture is strong, the candidate did not reference how they would fit into the specific culture and values at Fleet Data Centers, which is a notable gap.                                                                                      |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 3/10   | The journey from software engineering to technical program management is evident, but the lack of direct experience in managing data center infrastructure projects raises concern about their preparedness for this specific role.                                                               |

### üßæ Summary

The candidate possesses a solid technical foundation with experience in project management within software development and team leadership. However, there are gaps in domain-specific knowledge relating to data center infrastructure and management of physical construction projects. Their communication and leadership skills are strong, yet they need to better align their narrative and experience with the requirements of the Senior Technical Program Manager role at Fleet Data Centers, particularly in terms of physical infrastructure delivery and cost management metrics. The transition from software engineering to program management is clear but lacks direct application to the challenges this role presents.
