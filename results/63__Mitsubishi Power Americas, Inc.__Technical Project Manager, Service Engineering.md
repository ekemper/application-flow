| Technical Skills                       | 15/25     | The candidate demonstrates a strong technical foundation with experience in software engineering and project management, but lacks specific experience in rotating equipment and service engineering that is crucial for this role. |
| Relevant Experience                    | 12/20     | Experience as a Technical Program Manager is present, but the candidate does not have the required 8 years in rotating equipment design or combined cycle power plant experience. |
| Domain Knowledge                       | 5/10      | Limited domain knowledge in the power plant operations and maintenance sector, as most experience is rooted in software and technology rather than the required mechanical engineering context. |
| Communication Skills                   | 9/10      | Strong communication skills are evident through the resume and cover letter, showcasing effective stakeholder management and leadership abilities. |
| Motivation & Alignment                 | 10/15     | Expresses motivation but needs better alignment to the technical project management aspect specific to the power sector, which could improve cultural and organizational fit. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit         | 8/10      | Displays values of empathy and collaboration, aligning with team expectations. However, needs to emphasize adaptability to high-pressure environments specific to engineering. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment     | 4/10      | The current trajectory is somewhat misaligned; while on a path toward TPM, lacks emphasis on roles relevant to this specific engineering niche. Fade out of specific team management roles. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate showcases a solid background in technical program management, with experience leading cross-functional teams and delivering projects. However, the lack of domain-specific knowledge in rotating equipment and power plant operations is a significant gap. The communication skills and collaborative mindset are evident, which are positive attributes. Nevertheless, a clearer demonstration of alignment with the technical requirements and cultural fit of the engineering sector is necessary to enhance candidacy.
