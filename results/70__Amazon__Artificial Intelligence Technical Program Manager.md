|--------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate's technical skills are strong, with demonstrated proficiency in various software technologies and systems. However, a clearer emphasis on AI technologies mentioned in the job description would strengthen the alignment.  |
