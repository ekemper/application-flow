#### üßæ Summary

The candidate is well-experienced in technical program management and project leadership, showcasing skills in agile methodologies, risk management, and communication. However, there's a noticeable lack of direct experience in IT project management within an infrastructure context, which is critical for this role. The focus appears to be more on software engineering than on the specific IT management tasks outlined in the job description. Overall, the candidate demonstrates a strong potential fit but may require additional experience in IT-focused environments.
