| Technical Skills                | 20/25  | The candidate displays a strong technical foundation with expertise in several programming languages and technologies relevant to the role. However, a focus on TPM experience could have elevated the score further.           |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20  | The candidate possesses substantial experience in software engineering and a technical program management role. However, the recent construction management position might detract from the relevant experience in a tech context. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10   | Candidate's background in software engineering aligns well, but experience specifically in the retail e-commerce space, particularly consumer-facing systems, is lacking.                                                         |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10   | Strong communication skills are demonstrated in the cover letter and resume, showcasing an ability to lead diverse teams and present to stakeholders.                                                                            |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15  | The candidate shows enthusiasm and a desire to contribute positively to the organization's mission. However, tying personal goals more closely to Walmart's strategic objectives could enhance the fit.                               |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 7/10   | The candidate's embrace of transparency and psychological safety in team management fits well with Walmart's focus on collaboration; however, more direct references to Walmart's values could strengthen this further.               |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 8/10   | A well-defined career trajectory leading towards leadership in technical roles, but a clearer alignment with the specific growth path of the Technical Program Manager role at Walmart would enhance the evaluation.              |
