| Technical Skills               | 20/25     | The candidate exhibits strong technical skills with a solid foundation in software engineering, APIs, and CI/CD processes. However, the role's focus on medical device regulations is a missing element. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a strong technical background with significant project management experience, particularly in software development and engineering. However, a notable gap is evident in his direct experience within the medical device industry, which is central to the role at Gilero. Additionally, while his communication skills and leadership attributes are commendable, they may not fully translate to managing the unique challenges presented in the healthcare sector. The candidate's experience managing engineering teams is strong but may not convince hiring managers given the specific domain focus of this opportunity.
