|----------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 22/25 | The candidate's proficiency in cloud technologies (AWS, GCP), API development, and automation tools is strong, aligning well with required skills. A broader emphasis on cloud infrastructure management would strengthen their profile. |
| Relevant Experience              | 17/20 | The candidate has 11 years of diverse experience, including roles as a Technical Project Manager and Software Engineer. However, specific experience in building cloud regions is lacking, leading to minor deductions. |

| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | Clear articulation of projects and proactive stakeholder engagement shown. A slightly higher emphasis on data presentation to senior leadership could improve this category. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 15/15 | The candidate aligns well with Oracle's mission and prospective role, showcasing a keen interest in driving customer-focused innovations. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 8/10  | Demonstrates empathy and leadership that aligns with Oracle's values. Some descriptors of flexibility and resilience in ambiguous situations could be more pronounced. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10 | Transitioning from a Senior Engineer to a Technical Program Manager is evident, but a clear pathway to the specific seniority level sought (IC5) could be bolstered. |
