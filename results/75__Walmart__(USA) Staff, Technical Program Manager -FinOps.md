| Technical Skills                    | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills relevant to program management. However, the focus on software engineering is slightly misaligned with the requirements for a TPM role.                               |
| Relevant Experience                 | 15/20 | Significant experience in technical roles and program management is evident, but lacks specific experience in FinOps as stated in the job description.                                           |
| Domain Knowledge                    | 6/10  | The candidate holds relevant experience in technology and program management but does not mention FinOps, which is important for this position.                                               |

| Cultural or Organizational Fit      | 8/10  | The candidate effectively communicates a positive leadership style. However, more emphasis on experience in a culture similar to Walmart's would strengthen this score.                         |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment  | 7/10  | The candidate's career trajectory shows growth and relevant experience, but there is a lack of direct experience in FinOps which is a significant component of this role.                        |
