### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper has a solid technical foundation and experience in leading teams, making him a potentially strong candidate for the Technical Program Manager role at Amazon. His background in software engineering is extensive, and he demonstrates a proactive attitude towards leadership and cross-team collaboration.
