|-------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                           | 18/25 | The candidate demonstrates a strong background in software engineering and technical program management. However, specific experience in data engineering and big data processing, which are crucial for the role, is not evident. There are also no indications of direct work with data security or governance, which are explicitly mentioned in the job description.  |
| Relevant Experience                        | 15/20 | The candidate has relevant experience in managing technical projects and leading cross-functional teams. Nevertheless, the majority of the experience seems heavily skewed towards software engineering roles rather than specific program management within data engineering, which detracts from alignment with the position requirements.                                                              |
| Domain Knowledge                           | 7/10  | The candidate has solid experience related to software engineering and project management. However, specific knowledge in the financial services domain, as Capital One operates, is not present.                                                                                                                                                |
| Communication Skills                       | 9/10  | The cover letter and resume clearly articulate the candidate‚Äôs experiences and viewpoints. They demonstrate effective communication skills, especially when translating technical information for non-technical stakeholders.                                                                                                                           |
| Motivation & Alignment                     | 12/15 | The candidate expresses enthusiasm for the Technical Program Manager role and aligns their technical leadership experience with the job requirements. However, a more explicit connection between their past experiences and the financial services industry could strengthen their application.                                                                                     |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit             | 7/10  | There is a demonstrated focus on fostering team collaboration and inclusivity, which is aligned with organizational culture expectations. Additional emphasis on adapting to Capital One's specific company culture would enhance this score.                                                                                                    |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment         | 12/10 | The candidate‚Äôs trajectory shows progression from technical roles to program management, aligning well with the expectations for a Technical Program Manager. They bring over a decade's experience, which suits a senior position.                                                                                                                     |
