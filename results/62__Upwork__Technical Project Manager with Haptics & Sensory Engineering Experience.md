|----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                 | 18/25   | Strong technical skills in software engineering are demonstrated, but there's a lack of specific experience with haptics and sensory technology, which is essential for the role.                              |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20   | The candidate has solid PM experience but aligns more with software engineering than technical program management specifically related to haptics.                                           |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10    | Limited knowledge of haptics and sensory technology; these are crucial for the role as stated in the job description.                                                              |
| Communication Skills             | 9/10    | Excellent communication skills showcased in both the resume and cover letter; effectively articulates experiences and soft skills.                                                                      |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 8/15    | Motivated and aligned with project management, but specific alignment with haptics/sensory technology is lacking.                                                                |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 4/10    | While collaborative efforts mentioned, there isn't specific evidence of working with global teams or adapting to different working cultures, which is preferred.                               |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 3/10    | Transitioning from software engineering to project management is noted, but deeper alignment with the specific requirements of the role is needed.                                                |
