| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 2/10  | The trajectory seems to be more aligned with software engineering rather than the direct-to-consumer eCommerce focus needed for this role. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward brings a strong technical background with over a decade of experience in various roles. However, there‚Äôs a notable gap in direct experience related to eCommerce project management. While he has led teams and managed projects, his focus has largely been on software engineering rather than the digital retail space crucial for the position at Crocs. Additionally, while his communication and leadership skills are strong overall, they aren't as well aligned with the specific requirements of leading eCommerce projects or adapting to the rapid evolution of digital marketing and sales.
