|--------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Technical Skills               | 20/25    | The candidate possesses a strong range of technical competencies, especially in software engineering and project management tools. However, the job specifically requires knowledge in solar PV systems or energy storage, where the candidate has limited direct experience. |
| Relevant Experience            | 15/20    | The candidate demonstrates solid experience in program and project management roles but does not meet the specific requirement of 5+ years in the electrical industry, nor do they showcase a significant background in solar energy project management. |
| Domain Knowledge               | 5/10     | The candidate has limited direct experience in the solar energy sector or electrical systems, which is vital for this role. Their previous projects do not indicate a focus on renewable energy projects. |
| Communication Skills           | 9/10     | Strong communication skills are evidenced in both the resume and cover letter, where the candidate expresses thoughts clearly and illustrates previous team interactions well. |
| Motivation & Alignment         | 10/15    | The candidate shows passion for project management and technical leadership, but lacks a clear connection to the specific mission and values of Ingeteam, which may impact their alignment with company culture. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit | 6/10     | While the candidate emphasizes teamwork and leadership, more examples within the context of electrical or renewable energy industries could enhance their fit for the organization. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10 | The career progression suggests a strong technical background transitioning toward project management. However, the lack of focus on the required industry limits the alignment with the role. |
