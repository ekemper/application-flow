| Technical Skills                 | 20/25   | 25         | The candidate exhibits strong technical skills, particularly in software engineering and development tools. However, the focus on engineering detracts from demonstrating explicit project management skills required for the role.|

### üßæ Summary

The candidate possesses an impressive technical background with a solid foundation in software engineering and project leadership. However, there are notable gaps in direct project management experiences, particularly in renewable energy, which significantly impacts their fit for this role. Their cover letter hints at a keen understanding of project management principles, but the lack of relevant domain knowledge is a concern. The candidate will need to focus on more explicitly demonstrating their project management skills and experience in related industries to enhance their suitability.
