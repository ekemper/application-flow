#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 15/25 | The candidate demonstrates a solid foundation in software engineering and technical program management. However, their background is heavily software-focused rather than water resources or environmental engineering, which is a key requirement. |
| Relevant Experience              | 10/20 | While the candidate has experience managing projects, much of it is in software development, not directly related to water resources or civil engineering. The career trajectory does not clearly align with the requirements of the role. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 0/10  | No relevant experience or education in civil or environmental engineering is apparent, which is crucial for this position. |
| Communication Skills             | 7/10  | The candidate demonstrates strong verbal and written communication skills in their cover letter and professional experience. However, there could be stronger examples of stakeholder management specifically in the context of infrastructure projects. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 5/15  | Although there is a passion for leadership and development, there seems to be a lack of specific alignment with the water resources domain and the mission of Jacobs. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 7/10  | The applicant‚Äôs focus on team dynamics and collaboration is positive. However, the cultural alignment with a civil/environmental firm could be clearer. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10  | The candidate has moved into program management roles, but their experience lacks the specific industry trajectory Jacobs is looking for. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward brings a wealth of experience in software engineering and program management, showcasing strong technical leadership in various projects. However, the lack of direct domain experience in water resources or civil engineering presents a significant gap when compared to the specific requirements of the Water Resources Project Manager role. Additionally, the educational background does not align with the expected qualifications for this position, which could impede progression in the interview process. While Edward has valuable skills and transferable experience, a different engineering discipline focus will require adjustment to fit this role.
