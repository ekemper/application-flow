#### üßæ Summary

Edward's resume and cover letter reflect strong technical and project management skills, primarily in software engineering. However, the specific requirements of the Senior Project Manager role at AECOM necessitate experience and knowledge in the water/wastewater industry and design-build methodologies, which Edward lacks. While he demonstrates enthusiasm and leadership qualities, there could be stronger alignment with AECOM‚Äôs objectives and specific cultural values. The overall fit appears moderate, though there are clear strengths in general project management.
