#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score  | Feedback |
|--------------------------------|--------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25  | The candidate showcases extensive technical skills relevant to project management and software engineering, including key tools (like AWS, Docker, etc.) and methodologies (Agile, DevOps). However, there is an overemphasis on development skills, which could detract from the focused project management skills needed for this role. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20  | The candidate has significant experience leading teams and managing projects, but some roles lean heavily towards software engineering without clear project management focused outcomes. The transition from Senior Software Engineer roles to a Project Manager could be clearer. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10   | The candidate does not clearly demonstrate experience in the healthcare industry, which is vital for this role at Cardinal Health, despite a strong technical background. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10   | The candidate displays strong communication abilities through their resumes and cover letters, often highlighting effective stakeholder interaction and reporting. Improved specificity on communication strategies would be beneficial. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15  | The applicant expresses motivation for the role, but the connection between their past experiences and the specific mission of Cardinal Health remains somewhat underdeveloped. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 3/10   | While the candidate emphasizes team dynamics and empathy, there‚Äôs insufficient alignment with Cardinal Health's cultural values, particularly in the context of their DEI initiatives. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 5/10   | The applicant has a broad tech background but lacks direct alignment with a purely project management trajectory, particularly in the healthcare space. Reiterating how past IT/engineering management relates to this PM role would enhance this score. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate presents a robust technical background with transferable skills from software engineering to project management. However, the fit for the Technical Project Manager role at Cardinal Health is less convincing due to lacking direct experience in healthcare and insufficient emphasis on project management tasks. The applicant should strengthen the alignment of their experiences to the specific responsibilities outlined in the job description, especially regarding financial acumen and healthcare domain experience.
