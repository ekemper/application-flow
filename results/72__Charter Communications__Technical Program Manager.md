| Technical Skills               | 18/25  | 25         | The candidate demonstrates proficiency in various technical skills relevant to software development and project management but could strengthen specific knowledge in tools or methods explicitly mentioned in the JD (e.g., Agile tools). |
| Relevant Experience            | 14/20  | 20         | Has solid experience in technical program management roles, but lacks 5+ years of pure TPM experience as outlined in the JD. The experience is robust but heavily leans on engineering rather than program management roles.   |
| Domain Knowledge               | 8/10   | 10         | Strong domain knowledge in software and engineering, particularly in technical project management, aligns well with the communications industry focus.                                      |
| Communication Skills           | 9/10   | 10         | Excellent clarity and storytelling in the cover letter. Demonstrates good interpersonal skills, which is vital for stakeholder management.                                           |
| Motivation & Alignment         | 10/15  | 15         | The candidate expresses genuine interest in the role and company mission; however, the motivation could be strengthened by clearer alignment with Charter Communications' specific needs.  |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit | 7/10   | 10         | Shows understanding of fostering positive team dynamics through the cover letter examples but could elaborate more on collaboration with diverse stakeholders.  |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 6/10   | 10         | The transition from software engineering to program management is clear, but there might be a lack of direct alignment with technical program management in the recent roles.                          |

### üßæ Summary

The candidate, Edward Kemper, presents considerable technical acumen and relevant experience in software engineering. However, there is insufficient direct experience in a pure technical program management capacity, which is a key requirement for the role. His strong communication skills and evidence of team leadership are notable, but a stronger focus on strategic program management experiences could bolster his application. Overall, he is a promising candidate with sound technical expertise but may need to address specific gaps to fully align with the job requirements.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Parsing Errors (if any)

- Missing job title in the job description (`"name": null` should specify a title). 
- Missing posting date (`"posted": null`).
- The salary is spread across multiple fields, which is not standard practice (`"extensions"` and `"detected_extensions"` containing similar information).  

This candidate needs to address areas where direct alignment with Technical Program Manager experience is lacking, particularly the strategic management of projects instead of solely technical execution.
