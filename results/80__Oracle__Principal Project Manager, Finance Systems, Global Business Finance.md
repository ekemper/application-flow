|-----------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                  | 20/25 | Edward has extensive technical skills as evidenced by his experience in software engineering, API development, and cloud technologies. However, the role primarily focuses on project management within finance systems, so further emphasis on project management technologies could strengthen this score.                                    |
| Relevant Experience                 | 15/20 | Edward has managed various projects but lacks specific experience in finance system projects. His software background is robust but may not entirely align with the financial domain required for this position. Some project management experience, such as leading teams or managing finance-related projects, is less emphasized. |
| Domain Knowledge                  | 5/10  | While Edward has project management experience, he appears to lack direct knowledge in financial systems or plugins, which is a key requirement for the role at Oracle.                                                                                                                         |
| Communication Skills              | 8/10  | Communication skills seem strong as Edward's cover letter articulates experience in aligning teams and stakeholders effectively. His focus on fostering an inclusive team environment adds to his communication competency.                                                                                                                              |
| Motivation & Alignment            | 10/15 | Edward expresses an eagerness to contribute to the organization's success but could further align his motivation with Oracle's specific goals or values, particularly in finance and technology.                                                                                                                  |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit    | 8/10  | Edward's values around psychological safety and team empowerment resonate well with Oracle's likely culture of collaboration, but further specific references to Oracle or financial industry standards could enhance this aspect.                                                                                            |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 14/10 | Edward's transition from a technical background to project management roles aligns well with the progression expected for this position. His diverse experience provides a solid foundation for further responsibilities.                                                                                             |
