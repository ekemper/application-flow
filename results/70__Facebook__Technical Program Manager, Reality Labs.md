| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates a robust technical skill set, particularly in software engineering, which is strong but leans more towards engineering than TPM-specific skills. Deduction for absence of explicit experience with consumer devices. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | The candidate's experience includes team leadership and program management, but TPM roles are less emphasized. Notable gaps in explicit cross-functional product delivery roles. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | The candidate has some relevant experience (e.g., in software and technology), but lacks demonstrated experience in hardware development, crucial for the target role. |
| Communication Skills             | 7/10  | Strong communication skills evidenced in the cover letter with examples of stakeholder engagement but could be more aligned with influencing higher-level executives. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15 | The candidate shows enthusiasm for the role and aligns well with the company‚Äôs mission but could better articulate long-term career vision. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 8/10  | Emphasizes servant leadership and psychological safety, which are strong cultural matches for an innovative company like Facebook. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 2/10  | Experience primarily as a software engineer, and a lack of direct managerial experience in a TPM context negatively influences alignment for this seniority level. |

### üßæ Summary

Overall, Edward Kemper presents a strong foundation in technical skills and a variety of relevant experiences in software engineering and project management. However, there are concerns regarding the direct relevance of his experiences to the Technical Program Manager role, particularly in terms of cross-functional delivery in a consumer hardware context. The absence of demonstrated leadership in a TPM capacity and specific experiences tied to hardware/software integration could be potential red flags in meeting the high expectations of this role.
