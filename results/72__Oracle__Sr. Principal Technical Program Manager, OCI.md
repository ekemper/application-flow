We\u2019re also working on new ingenuities such as providing canonical implementation of core components for data planes through a data-plane runtime framework, developing a remote persistent storage solution with the latency and performance comparable to that of a local nVME drive, and developing standards and tools to identify critical performance improvements across OCI data-planes. We are hoping to enhance engineering efficiency by concentrating our expertise on building low level systems with high performance that can be adopted by our core cloud services across OCI.\n\nIn addition, TSO organization is charged with creation and governance of the OCI-wide programs to improve organizational engineering standards, governing processes, architectural review boards, change management, intercoms, PSA\u2019s, and recruiting tools.\n\nWe are looking for hands-on TPM\u2019s with expertise and passion in solving difficult problems in all areas of cloud service software engineering: high scale distributed systems, virtualized infrastructure, identity, security, observability, and user experience.\n\nThis is a greenfield opportunity to design and build new cloud services from the ground up.

The position relies heavily on influence rather than authority to drive projects.\n\nYou will define project scopes, plan and direct schedules while focusing on regular and timely delivery of value; organize and lead project status and working meetings; prepare and distribute progress reports; manage risks and issues; correct deviations from plans; and perform delivery planning for assigned projects.\n\nYou will monitor the project from initiation through delivery. Organize the interdepartmental activities ensuring completion of the project/product on schedule and within budget constraints. You will assign and monitor work of systems analysis and program staff, providing technical support and direction.\n\nYou will collaborate closely with our partners in program and product management to understand our customers and build the right solutions and products that makes their needs and businesses complete.\n\nYou should possess exceptional problem-solving skills, strong business judgment, and notable experience collaborating in hybrid teams. You are a self-starter technical leader with a shown ability to execute both strategically and tactically, and someone who is excited to take on new projects.\n\nYou have strong interpersonal skills including mentoring, coaching, collaborating, and team building.
