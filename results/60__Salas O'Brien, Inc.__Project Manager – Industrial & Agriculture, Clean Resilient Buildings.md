|--------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| Technical Skills               | 20/25       | The candidate showcases a solid foundation in technical skills relevant to program management, especially in engineering and software. However, there is a heavier emphasis on software development rather than direct TPM-related skills, which detracts from the alignment. |
| Relevant Experience             | 15/20       | Significant experience in leading projects and teams, but the candidate lacks substantial TPM roles specifically mentioned, impacting the score. The recent project management experience in construction may not fully apply to the required industry focus. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 7/10        | Some knowledge in energy technologies is implied but not directly demonstrated, which is crucial for the specific role in industrial energy management. |
| Communication Skills            | 9/10        | Effective communication skills are presented in both the resume and cover letter, showcasing leadership and stakeholder management abilities.|
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15       | The cover letter expresses enthusiasm, but it lacks specific alignment to the particular missions of Salas O'Brien, which could strengthen the application.|
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 5/10        | There is an understanding of team dynamics and values; however, the alignment with Salas O'Brien‚Äôs specific values and initiatives is not fully clear. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 4/10   | The candidate's recent transition back to technical roles (from software engineering to project management) may raise concerns about long-term commitment to and focus on TPM roles in a different industry. |
