| Technical Skills                       | 15/25  | 25         | The candidate has a wide range of technical skills but leans heavily on software engineering, with less emphasis on the specific cloud-native solutions required by the job description.                      |
| Relevant Experience                    | 15/20  | 20         | Some relevant experience in program management is evident, but there's insufficient depth in managing cloud-based projects and large-scale transformations as outlined in the role.                          |
| Domain Knowledge                       | 5/10   | 10         | The candidate exhibits familiarity with software engineering concepts but lacks mention of telecom-specific OSS/BSS systems and in-depth knowledge of the fiber and cloud industry.                            |
| Communication Skills                   | 8/10   | 10         | Strong communication skills displayed in both the resume and cover letter; the candidate articulates experiences and leadership styles well.                                                              |
| Motivation & Alignment                 | 10/15  | 15         | Shows strong enthusiasm for the role and alignment with GFiber's mission, but could include more personalization or references to how their past aligns with GFiber's cloud services goals.                      |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit         | 10/10  | 10         | The candidate emphasizes inclusive team dynamics and values psychological safety, aligning well with GFiber's culture of community and accountability.                                                      |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment     | 7/10   | 10         | The transition from a software engineering background to a Program Management role is evident, yet there is a concern regarding the lack of direct experience leading significant TPM initiatives under a cloud context, which is critical for this role. |
