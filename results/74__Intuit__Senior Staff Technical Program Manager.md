| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills in software engineering, API development, and CI/CD processes. However, their experience leans heavily on software engineering rather than program management. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | The candidate has relevant experience as a Technical Program Manager and a Senior Software Engineer, but the recent Construction Project Manager role does not align well with TPM responsibilities. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | Experience spans various industries, but lacks specific mention of experience in platform organization or other tech domains.                               |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | Overall strong; examples illustrate effective communication with stakeholders. Further evidence of synthesizing narratives for senior leaders is needed.            |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15 | The candidate expresses passion for the role and company mission but could better articulate their desire to transition fully into program management.           |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 6/10  | Displays team leadership values and fosters a supportive work environment, aligning somewhat with the company's collaborative culture but lacks direct references to organizational change. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10/10 | The progression from software roles to program manager fits the trajectory, although a more focused alignment with program management responsibilities would strengthen it. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate presents a strong technical background and has a diverse set of experiences spanning software development and program management. However, there are notable gaps in direct experience related to platform organization and large-scale transformational initiatives, which are critical for the Senior Staff Technical Program Manager role at Intuit. The candidate could enhance their candidacy by explicitly connecting experiences to the role's requirements, particularly in the areas of organizational change and effective leadership at scale.
