#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper demonstrates a solid foundation in both technical and project management skills, making him a competent candidate for the Technical Program Manager role. However, he has significant experience in software engineering that overshadows his program management experience, which can be a concern given the specific requirements of the TPM role at Google. There are a few areas for improvement regarding direct experience with release management and more explicit connections to Google's mission.
