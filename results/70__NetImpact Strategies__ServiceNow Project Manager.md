|---------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 20/25 | Edward demonstrates strong technical skills in various programming languages and technologies relevant to software projects. However, the job description emphasizes IT Engineering and ServiceNow experience, which wasn't clearly represented in the resume. |
| Relevant Experience             | 13/20 | The candidate has significant software engineering experience but less direct experience as a Project Manager in the Services or IT domain, particularly with federal clients as required by the job description. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 5/10  | Edward has worked in different engineering environments, but lacks specific experience in government contracting or federal consulting, which is preferred in this role. |
| Communication Skills            | 8/10  | The cover letter and resume showcase strong communication abilities, particularly in stakeholder management and team leadership. However, examples of management reports and dashboards could enhance this further. |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15 | The candidate expresses strong enthusiasm for the role and highlights relevant past experiences, but lacks specific alignment with the company's focus on federal projects. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 5/10  | While the candidate emphasizes a collaborative approach, there's little direct evidence of alignment with NetImpact‚Äôs mission and values related to federal service. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 4/10  | The transition from software engineering to project management can be challenging without clear examples of project management roles or responsibilities, especially in federal IT contexts. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper brings a wealth of technical experience and a solid foundation in project management. His software engineering background is robust, featuring leadership and process improvement initiatives. However, he needs to bolster his alignment with the specific requirements of the Technical Project Manager role at NetImpact Strategies, especially in federal consulting contexts. The absence of relevant project experience and certifications related to ServiceNow and ITIL are notable gaps. Overall, Edward has potential but could enhance his candidacy with targeted experience and a clearer demonstration of alignment with the role's needs.
