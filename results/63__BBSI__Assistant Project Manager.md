#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents as a technically proficient individual with significant experience in software development and project management. However, the shift to an Assistant Project Manager in construction may not be seamless, given the lack of relevant domain experience outlined in the job description. His background in leading technical projects is a strong advantage, but without specific construction management knowledge and skills, the fit for this role may be limited. This presents a notable gap considering the critical nature of understanding construction processes and safety standards in this position.
