|---------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 20/25 | The candidate has a strong technical background with extensive experience in software development and technical program management.

| Motivation & Alignment          | 15/15 | The candidate‚Äôs interest in the role aligns well with their past experiences and their proactive approach to team culture is commendable. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 8/10  | The candidate's emphasis on collaboration and team dynamics suggests a good cultural fit with Truelogic's team-oriented values, though explicit references to DEI initiatives could strengthen this further. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 6/10  | The candidate‚Äôs transition from engineering to project management is a positive aspect, but it lacks explicit ties to a continuous path in project management leadership. |
