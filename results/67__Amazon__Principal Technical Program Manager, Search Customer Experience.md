#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a solid technical background with 11 years of experience, particularly in software engineering and leadership roles. However, there‚Äôs a pronounced focus on software engineering rather than on Technical Program Management, which is a drawback for a Principal TPM role at Amazon. The candidate's cover letter offers a compelling narrative, but it lacks stronger alignment with the specific qualities and challenges present in the job description. This disconnect raises concerns regarding their direct suitability for the position, particularly in an eCommerce context.
