#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score    | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25    | The candidate demonstrates a robust set of technical skills relevant to software engineering and technical program management, particularly in API development and cloud technologies. However, there's an overemphasis on engineering without emphasizing specific TPM methodologies or relevant tools for project management required in the job description. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20    | The candidate has relevant experience leading both engineering teams and TPM processes. However, the projects listed primarily showcase software engineering, with less direct experience in multi-discipline project management, specifically in MEP fields, which the role requires. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 7/10     | While the candidate has experience in technical project management, there is little to no direct experience in building design or the MEP domain. This is crucial as the new position specializes in those areas. |
| Communication Skills             | 10/10    | The candidate‚Äôs cover letters and resume exhibit excellent communication skills, evident in the clear articulation of project goals and team dynamics management. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15    | The candidate shows strong motivation and alignment with leadership values. However, their enthusiasm is more aligned with technology-focused environments rather than the construction and building design industry. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10     | While cultural fit indicators are present, such as team leadership styles, they may not fully resonate with the specific organizational culture of Sidara, which emphasizes environmental sustainability and diverse community connection. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 3/10     | The candidate's trajectory shows a shift towards PM roles, but their lack of specific experience in the MEP sector and the need for 8+ years in relevant engineering consulting shows a significant gap. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills and a solid foundation in project management and leadership. However, their background skews strongly towards software engineering rather than the multi-discipline project management in the MEP domain. The lack of direct experience in building design projects presents a notable gap when matched to the job description. While their motivations and communication skills are commendable, there's a lack of alignment between their career trajectory and the specific needs of the MEP-focused role.
