### üßæ Summary
The candidate brings over a decade of experience primarily in software engineering and project management. Their strong foundation in technical skills, particularly in agile methodologies and software development, is notable. However, gaps in direct experience with networking, telecommunications infrastructure, and the specific requirements of the job mean they may need to bridge several gaps to fully align with the role at Gogo Business Aviation. Overall, while there are strengths in communication and collaborative leadership, the candidate's experience needs to more closely match the technical and domain expertise required for this senior technical project management position.
