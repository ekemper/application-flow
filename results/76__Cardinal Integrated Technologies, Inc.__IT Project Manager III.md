#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                          | Max Points | Score | Feedback |
|-----------------------------------|------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                  | 25         | 20/25 | Candidate demonstrates strong technical skills relevant to project management but has a heavy emphasis on software engineering. A more balanced focus on specific project management methodologies would improve the score. |
| Relevant Experience                | 20         | 15/20 | Relevant experience in technical project management is evident, but current role focuses on construction rather than IT, which may not fully align with IT project management requirements. |
| Domain Knowledge                   | 10         | 5/10 | Experience is lacking in managing SAP migrations and specific IT project management, which are critical to the job description. |
| Communication Skills               | 10         | 8/10 | Excellent communication skills are showcased through the cover letter, but specific examples of liaising between technical and non-technical departments could enhance this further. |
| Motivation & Alignment             | 15         | 12/15 | Cover letter expresses clear motivation and understanding of the role; however, the fit within the specific sector (information systems) could be addressed more directly. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit     | 10         | 8/10 | The emphasis on servant leadership and team culture is strong, but more explicit connection to the company's values would be advantageous. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10         | 8/10 | Career trajectory shows robust experience but transitions into IT project management could be better articulated. |
