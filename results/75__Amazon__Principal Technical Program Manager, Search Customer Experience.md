| Relevant Experience            | 15/20  | While the candidate has experience in software engineering and some aspects of technical program management, they lack sufficient direct experience managing programs across cross-functional teams, particularly at the senior level mentioned in the job description. |
| Domain Knowledge               | 8/10   | The candidate shows familiarity with project management in a technical environment, but their specific experience in customer-facing search functionalities, which is crucial for this role, is light.                                                      |
| Communication Skills           | 8/10   | The candidate illustrates solid communication capabilities in their cover letter and resumes. They also have successfully managed communication among stakeholders.                                                                        |

| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10/10  | The candidate‚Äôs journey from software engineering to a management role is apparent and aligns well with a transition to a Technical Program Manager.                                                                                                                                 |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate presents a solid background in technical roles primarily focused on software engineering and some program management experience. They demonstrate strong technical skills and have led projects; however, their direct experience with high-level program management, predominantly in customer-facing technology realms, appears insufficient for the Principal Technical Program Manager position at Amazon. There is a clear motivation for the role, but further connection to the company‚Äôs specific goals and values could enhance their candidacy.
