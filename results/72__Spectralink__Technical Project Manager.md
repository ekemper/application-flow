#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a solid profile as a candidate for the Technical Project Manager position with over 11 years of experience primarily in software engineering and technical program management. Key strengths include a strong technical background and effective communication skills.

Notable highlights include leading cross-functional teams and managing key initiatives, but an explicit focus on the specific domain knowledge required for the role at Spectralink is lacking. Overall, while the candidate is well-qualified, they may need to better articulate their capability in leading complex projects in relevant industries.
