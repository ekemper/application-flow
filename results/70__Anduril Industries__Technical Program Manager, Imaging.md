| Technical Skills                       | 20/25   | The candidate has a solid technical background (e.g., familiarity with software engineering, APIs, and cloud technologies), but lacks direct experience in system deployment and integration related to defense technology. |
| Relevant Experience                    | 15/20   | Experience as a Technical Project Manager and Senior Software Engineer is relevant; however, experience in a DOD environment is absent which is crucial for this role. |
| Domain Knowledge                       | 5/10    | The candidate lacks specific experience in the defense industry, which is significant since they will be addressing national security challenges.                             |
| Communication Skills                   | 8/10    | The candidate demonstrates strong written communication skills as seen in the cover letter, showcasing their ability to articulate complex ideas clearly.                    |
| Motivation & Alignment                 | 10/15   | The candidate reflects a motivational alignment with the organizational mission but lacks the specific drive expressed for defense sector roles.                              |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit         | 8/10    | There is a good fit based on previous team collaboration experience, but clarity about adaptive and introspective traits regarding leadership challenges needs improvement.  |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment     | 4/10    | The transition from software engineering to TPM is notable, but additional focus on leadership experience and outcomes would strengthen this category.                      |
