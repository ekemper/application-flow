| Category                                | Score | Feedback                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                        | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills, especially in software engineering and DevOps best practices, which aligns with the role. However, less emphasis on program management tools may need improvement. |
| Relevant Experience                     | 16/20 | The candidate has solid experience in software development roles and some project management; however, the transition from software engineering to a full TPM role is not as evident.   |
| Domain Knowledge                        | 8/10  | Familiarity with Ad Tech is desirable, but evident specifics regarding past experience in this domain are limited, leading to the slight deduction.                                   |
| Communication Skills                    | 8/10  | Communication skills are strong; the candidate articulates experiences well. However, more specific examples of presentations or communicating with senior stakeholders would enhance this category.               |
| Motivation & Alignment                  | 12/15 | The candidate expresses enthusiasm and relevant experience transitioning from software engineering to TPM. A stronger alignment with the company's mission in the cover letter could improve this score.             |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit          | 8/10  | The cover letter reflects understanding of organizational dynamics well, but more focus on DEI initiatives and team culture in previous roles could have strengthened this fit.         |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment      | 6/10  | The candidate's shift from engineering to program management is evident, but the focus should be more defined to meet the desired qualifications for a TPM.                             |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper has a robust background in technical management and software engineering, highlighted by strong project leadership and collaboration skills. However, his experience transitioning fully from a software engineer to a TPM role needs clearer demonstration, particularly concerning program management expertise and handling complex projects in a technology-driven domain such as Ad Tech. A stronger alignment with the specific demands of the TPM role outlined in the job description would enhance his candidacy.
