#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score  | Feedback                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                 | 15/25  | The candidate demonstrates proficiency in various technical skills, including cloud technologies (AWS, GCP), programming languages, and development methodologies. However, the focus is more on software engineering rather than program management, which is essential for the TPM role.                        |
| Relevant Experience              | 12/20  | The candidate has experience in roles that include team leadership and program management. However, the Technical Project Manager (Construction) role appears less relevant to fast-paced tech environments, which Oracle seeks.                                                                                  |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 7/10   | The resume shows relevant technical domain knowledge, especially in software engineering and program management. However, there's limited direct experience in GPU infrastructure and AI, which are critical for the Oracle position.                                                                             |
| Communication Skills             | 7/10   | The candidate illustrates effective communication skills in the cover letter, detailing collaborative experiences. However, the emphasis on software delivery rather than stakeholder influence could be better articulated.                                                                                 |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15  | The cover letter expresses enthusiasm for the role and aligns the candidate‚Äôs values with Oracle‚Äôs mission. However, there could be a stronger case made for how previous experiences prepare them for the AI infrastructure focus of the role.                                                                    |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 8/10   | The language used suggests a good fit for cultures that value collaboration and empathy. The mention of leadership philosophies aligns well with contemporary organizational values but should tie back to how it applies to the fast-paced, high-accountability environment at Oracle.                         |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 6/10   | While the candidate has a solid career history, the transition from a primarily technical role to a TPM role could be emphasized better. The candidate has not showcased a pathway to TPM at a high level, which raises concerns regarding fit for a senior manager role in a specialized area like GPU delivery. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate presents a strong technical foundation with over 11 years of experience in engineering and program management. They showcase a rich history of leading cross-functional teams and technical project delivery. However, the resume leans heavily towards software engineering, lacking explicit emphasis on TPM-specific experience and the AI/GPU domain, which is central to the Oracle role. While their communication skills and motivational alignment are solid, there are gaps in demonstrating relevant experience and a clear trajectory towards a TPM career in specialized tech.
