| Technical Skills                        | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates a strong technical background in software development and project management tools. However, the role requires extensive experience in privacy-related technologies, which isn't clearly evidenced.             |
| Relevant Experience                     | 17/20 | The candidate has over 11 years of relevant experience but transitions from software engineering roles to a technical project manager position, including varied roles in technical management. Some gaps in specific privacy leadership exist. |
| Domain Knowledge                        | 7/10  | Experience in compliance and regulatory environments is weakly reflected. This is critical for the role's focus on privacy infrastructure, leaving a gap in domain understanding compared to what the job requires.                      |

However, reinforcing specific details about their fit for the Privacy Infrastructure would strengthen this further. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit          | 7/10  | The candidate highlights organizational fit and cultural alignment, but further emphasis on values specifically related to Meta's diverse teams and privacy efforts would enhance this.                                                  |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment      | 10/10 | The progression from engineering to technical program management aligns well with the current role's requirements, showing growth and expanded responsibilities effectively.                                                                |
