They need to connect their motivations to the cloud infrastructure space, especially in relation to the job description. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10     | The candidate does address team dynamics and collaboration, but doesn't heavily focus on driving diverse team performance, which is crucial to Microsoft‚Äôs culture. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10/10    | The candidate‚Äôs trajectory shows growth and increasing responsibility, aligning well with the position‚Äôs requirements. Their evolution from engineer to TPM is clear. |
