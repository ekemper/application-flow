| Technical Skills                 | 20/25  | Edward possesses a robust technical skill set with experience in a range of technologies. However, his experience leans heavily towards software engineering rather than program management, which is a key focus for the role. |
| Relevant Experience              | 10/20  | While he has relevant experiences in project and program management, his recent roles have been predominantly in software engineering, which does not align strongly with the technical program management focus.                 |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10   | Edward's past work in technical program management and software engineering provides some domain knowledge but is less relevant to the consumer electronics manufacturing industry, where extensive knowledge is crucial.  |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10   | He demonstrates strong communication skills in his resume and cover letter, highlighting his ability to collaborate with various stakeholders effectively.                       |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15  | Edward expresses a solid motivation for the role, but could provide more specific reasons for his interest in the consumer electronics domain and how that aligns with his background.|
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10   | His focus on psychological safety and servant leadership indicates a good cultural alignment, but further evidence of adaptability to a fast-paced, matrixed environment would strengthen his fit.                                                                                          |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 5/10   | Edward shows a transition path into Technical Program Management but lacks extensive management experience in that area, which is critical for this role.                       |
