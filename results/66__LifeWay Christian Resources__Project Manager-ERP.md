#### 🎯 Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|--------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills relevant to software engineering and project management. However, the focus should be more on project management tools and methodologies pertinent to ERP systems. |
| Relevant Experience              | 12/20 | Significant experience exists but lacks specific ERP implementation and Oracle Fusion knowledge, which is crucial for the role. The experience in project management, especially in managing large-scale projects, is noted, but it does not directly align with the ERP focus required. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | The candidate has limited exposure to ERP systems and lacks specific mention of Oracle or relevant project management methodologies in the context of ERP systems. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | Strong communication skills are illustrated in the candidate's projects and leadership roles, but the cover letter could better reflect how these skills translate into stakeholder management specifically for ERP projects. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15 | The candidate's background aligns with technical leadership, but there is a lack of explicit mention of alignment with Lifeway’s mission and values, particularly the evangelical component. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10  | The candidate does not demonstrate active involvement in an evangelical Christian community, which is a requirement for this role. This is a significant gap. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 6/10  | The career trajectory aligns with technical leadership; however, the move towards ERP project management is not directly indicated, leading to a modest score. |

#### 🧾 Summary

The candidate possesses a strong background in software engineering and program management, with admirable experiences leading engineering projects. However, gaps in ERP project management experience and knowledge about Oracle systems represent serious concerns, especially given the specific job requirements. The candidate's cultural fit appears inadequate due to a lack of mention of involvement in an evangelical church, which is a prerequisite for working at Lifeway. Overall, while technically proficient, the shortcomings in ERP domain knowledge and adherence to Lifeway's values are significant.
