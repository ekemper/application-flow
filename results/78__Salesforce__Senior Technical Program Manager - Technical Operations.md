|---------------------------------|-------|------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 18/25 | 25         | The candidate possesses a robust technical background, but the focus is slightly more on software engineering than on the project management aspect required by the role.

| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | 20         | The candidate has relevant experience as a Technical Program Manager and related roles, but some experiences are not specifically aligned with the expectations of managing complex technical programs in a tech-heavy environment like Salesforce. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 6/10  | 10         | The industry experience in tech is solid, but there is limited specific exposure mentioned regarding technical operations, a core requirement for the job. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | 10         | The cover letter and resume are well-articulated, reflecting strong communication skills. The candidate effectively demonstrates their ability to convey complex ideas clearly. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15 | 15         | There is a clear passion for technology and leadership expressed, but the motivation specific to Salesforce's mission could be articulated more clearly to show strong alignment. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 7/10  | 10         | The emphasis on fostering collaboration and innovation aligns with Salesforce's values, but additional concrete examples of this fit would strengthen this area. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 12/10 | 10         | The candidate's trajectory is impressive, with a blend of technical leadership and project management experience that aligns well with the role. |

#### üßæ Summary

Overall, Edward Kemper presents a compelling profile for the Senior Technical Program Manager role at Salesforce. He boasts extensive technical and project management experience, especially in software engineering, which is a strong asset. However, his application lacks a few alignment points for technical operations specifically, and there is a slight overweight on technical development over program management experience. Overall, he has demonstrated the core competencies needed, but more relevant context would be beneficial.
