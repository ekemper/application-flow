#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                               | Score | Feedback |
|----------------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                       | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills, particularly in software engineering and program management. However, there is a heavy emphasis on engineering roles rather than direct TPM experience, which slightly detracts from this category. |
| Relevant Experience                     | 13/20 | The candidate has relevant experience in software development and some project management, but their experience as a Technical Program Manager is limited. Notably, their most recent role is more focused on project management in construction rather than a technology-focused TPM role. |
| Domain Knowledge                        | 8/10  | The candidate has relevant experience in software development and some familiarity with digital health projects but lacks extensive direct experience in the digital health industry, which is a requirement for the role. |
| Communication Skills                    | 8/10  | Strong communication is evident in both the resume and cover letter, with specific examples of stakeholder collaboration and mentoring. |
| Motivation & Alignment                  | 10/15 | The cover letter expresses enthusiasm for the role, but the connection to the core mission of the company could be stronger. The candidate's transition from software engineering to TPM needs clearer articulation. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit          | 5/10  | The candidate demonstrates some team leadership experience but could clarify their direct experience in managing diverse teams or addressing cultural values that align with the company's expectations. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment      | 4/10  | The candidate has a strong technical background but lacks a clear trajectory towards technical program management, which raises concerns about their commitment and alignment with the TPM role. |

#### üßæ Summary
The candidate has an impressive technical background, particularly in software engineering, with over 11 years of experience.
