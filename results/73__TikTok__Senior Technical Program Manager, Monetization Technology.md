#### üßæ Summary  
Edward Kemper has a strong technical background with over 11 years of experience in software and technical program management. He has demonstrated his skills in leading cross-functional teams and delivering technical solutions. However, his experience is more heavily weighted toward software engineering than directly relevant program management in a monetization context. Opportunities exist to better highlight specific accomplishments related to the fiscal and strategic elements of prior projects. Overall, he presents a strong application but may need to align more closely with the monetization technology requirements of the TikTok role.
