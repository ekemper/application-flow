#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|--------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills, particularly in project management and cross-team collaboration. However, there is an overemphasis on software engineering, while the position requires more hardware-focused experience and knowledge. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | The candidate has notable experience, but their most recent role does not align closely enough with the requirements of a Project Manager in acoustics engineering. The lack of direct experience in hardware and acoustics diminishes relevance. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | The candidate lacks specific experience in acoustics or microphone technology, which are critical for the role. They have general engineering knowledge but not in the required domain. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | The cover letter and resume reflect strong communication skills with clear articulation of achievements and responsibilities. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 5/15  | The candidate shows limited alignment with the specific focus on hardware and acoustics in this role. Their interest appears to center more on software and program management. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10  | The candidate has experience working in collaborative environments, but their lack of direct experience in the target domain may limit their fit in a company like Apple that emphasizes innovation in hardware. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10  | The candidate has a solid career trajectory in tech positions; however, the transition to a more hardware-focused role is not well-established. |
