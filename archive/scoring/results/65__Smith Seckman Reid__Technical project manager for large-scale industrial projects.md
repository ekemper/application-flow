|--------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills               | 20/25   | The candidate showcases strong technical proficiency, particularly in software development and project management. However, a clearer emphasis on mechanical engineering would align better with the job description.                       |
| Relevant Experience             | 15/20   | While the candidate has valuable experience as a Technical Project Manager, they lack ten years specifically within project/client management as required.                                                                       |
| Domain Knowledge                | 5/10    | The experience primarily centers on software and engineering rather than large-scale industrial projects emphasized by the employer.                                                              |
| Communication Skills            | 10/10   | Communication skills are demonstrated well in the resume and cover letter through examples of teamwork and collaboration, indicating the ability to manage client expectations.                    |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15   | The applicant expresses strong motivation and alignment with the company's culture, but lacks clarity on their specific desire to transition into this domain effectively.                      |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 5/10    | There are references to teamwork and positive culture in past roles but a stronger connection to SSR's specific cultural values would be beneficial.                                            |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 5/10    | The transition from software engineering to project management is not fully articulated to show a strategic career trajectory toward the TPM role.                                                    |
