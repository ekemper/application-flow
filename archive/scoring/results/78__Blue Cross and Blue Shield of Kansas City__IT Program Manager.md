|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills               | 20/25  | Strong technical foundation with notable experience in software engineering and program management. While the technical skills section is robust, the emphasis is slightly weighted toward engineering rather than program management, which is pivotal for the role.                |
| Relevant Experience            | 15/20  | Over 11 years of experience; however, the Technical Project Manager role seems more construction-focused, which could misalign with the healthcare-centric projects of Blue Cross. Additionally, there's insufficient emphasis on direct IT program management experience.      |
| Domain Knowledge               | 5/10   | Experience in construction project management and software engineering, but limited exposure to healthcare systems or the specific industry domain required for the position. A deeper understanding of healthcare IT and insurance is beneficial.                                        |
| Communication Skills           | 8/10   | Strong communication skills demonstrated in team leadership roles and clear articulation of technical concepts in the cover letters. Other examples of clear stakeholder reporting would bolster this area.                                                                        |
| Motivation & Alignment         | 10/15  | The candidate shows enthusiasm for program management and software development but could further connect personal motivations to the specific mission and culture of Blue Cross, reinforcing their alignment with the organization's values.                                        |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit | 8/10   | Values of trust and collaboration align well with organizational expectations. A greater emphasis on adaptability and leading diverse teams would enhance cultural fit given the company's emphasis on DEI.                                              |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 12/10  | Strong background that aligns with a trajectory towards program management. However, the lack of a PMP certification may raise concerns for some employers, especially in formal program management roles. Credibility in the current role should be emphasized more.                           |
