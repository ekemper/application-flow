| Technical Skills                 | 15/25  | 25         | The candidate has notable technical skills, particularly in software engineering and API development. However, they lack specific deep security expertise and AI/ML security proficiency, which are critical for the role.      |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20  | 20         | The candidate demonstrates relevant experience in program management and leadership roles but lacks significant exposure to AI/ML security and specific security-focused TPM roles.                                             |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 7/10   | 10         | Limited experience in the AI and product security domains noted in the job description, affecting points in this category.                                                                                                     |
| Communication Skills             | 7/10   | 10         | Good communication skills evident in the resume and cover letter, particularly in articulating project outcomes and team dynamics.                                                                                             |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15  | 15         | The candidate expresses genuine interest and alignment with the job's mission but could strengthen this by directly addressing how their experience specifically aligns with the goals and values of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10   | 10         | While there is a focus on leadership and collaboration, the alignment with the specific cultural values of the organization, particularly inclusivity and community engagement, is not clearly articulated.                   |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 3/10   | 10         | The transition does not clearly highlight previous roles that map onto security-focused TPM expectations, leading to a lower score in this area.                                                                                |
