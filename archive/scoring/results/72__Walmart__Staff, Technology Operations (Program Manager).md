#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a solid case for a Technical Program Manager role with a strong background in technical and team leadership. Key strengths include practical experience in managing cross-functional teams and a commitment to communication and stakeholder engagement. However, there are gaps in specific regulatory and compliance domain knowledge, as well as a rigid focus on software engineering rather than Program Management experience in recent roles. Additionally, while communication and cultural fit are strong, deeper emphasis on diversity initiatives could enhance alignment with Walmart's values.
