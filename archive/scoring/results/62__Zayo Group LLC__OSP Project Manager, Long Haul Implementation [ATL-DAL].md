## üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a robust background in software engineering and project management with notable leadership skills.

While he shows potential in technical skills and motivation to lead, gaps in crucial domain knowledge and experience with regulatory environments are significant concerns. Overall, his deep technical background may not be sufficient without the specific industry experience required for this role.
