| Category                        | Score   | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|---------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 18/25   | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills in software engineering but lacks specific experience relevant to the hardware-focused battery industry. The skills mentioned (e.g., API development, DevOps) may not fully align with the emphasis on hardware product delivery specified in the job description. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20   | While the candidate has extensive experience in technical roles and management, most of their experience is in software rather than in the battery domain. The lack of relevant industry experience results in a deduction of points. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10    | The candidate has no apparent experience in the battery industry, which is a critical domain for this role, leading to a lower score. |
| Communication Skills             | 9/10    | The candidate's cover letters and resume show clear communication and strong leadership qualities, exemplified by their emphasis on stakeholder engagement and team collaboration. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15   | The candidate's motivation is somewhat evident but lacks direct alignment with the company's specific mission regarding battery technology. They should express a clearer interest in the industry shift. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 8/10    | The applicant highlights values such as empathy and cross-functional collaboration, which align well with positive team culture. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 7/10    | The transition from software to a more hardware-focused role is evident but not sufficiently justified in terms of relevance to the technical program manager duties detailed in the job description. |
