#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Max Points | Score | Feedback |
|---------------------------------|------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 25         | 15    | The candidate demonstrates solid technical skills in software development; however, the focus is more on engineering rather than technical program management. A more detailed emphasis on specific project management methodologies (e.g., Agile or Waterfall specific to project management) would be beneficial. |
| Relevant Experience             | 20         | 12    | While the candidate has experience in project management and various engineering roles, the lack of direct experience within the electric transmission sector, which is crucial for this position, impacts the score. The experience managing software projects doesn‚Äôt quite translate to transmission-specific capital projects. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 10         | 4     | The candidate lacks specific experience in electric transmission projects, which is a primary focus of the role. Understanding of utility regulations and industry practices is missing. |
| Communication Skills            | 10         | 8     | The candidate displays strong communication skills in their cover letter and project descriptions, demonstrating their ability to convey complex information effectively. |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 15         | 10    | The cover letter conveys a strong desire to transition into program management and aligns with team-oriented values, though the specifics about why they are interested in electric transmission are lacking. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 10         | 7     | There is an attempt to convey alignment with organizational values such as servant leadership; however, better explicit references to aligning with the company culture could enhance this score. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 10         | 8     | The transition from a technical role to program management suggests a positive career trajectory, but added clarity on how the candidate's future aspirations align specifically with the company‚Äôs growth and mission is needed. |

#### üßæ Summary
Edward Kemper brings over a decade of diverse technical experience, highlighting a strong background in software engineering and some project management elements. However, the significant gap in direct experience within electric transmission projects raises concerns about suitability for this role. The passion for transitioning into project management roles is clear, yet specific knowledge of the electric utility sector and its regulations is missing. Addressing these gaps in domain-specific knowledge will be crucial for Edward to increase candidacy prospects in related positions.
