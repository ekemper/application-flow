| Technical Skills                       | 15/25 | The candidate exhibits strong technical competencies in engineering but lacks emphasis on software project management skills, specifically Agile methodologies required by the role. |
| Relevant Experience                     | 10/20 | The experience in software development is strong; however, direct SDLC project management experience is unclear and only partially matches the required 5-6 years. |
| Domain Knowledge                        | 4/10  | Limited exposure to the specific software-oriented industries mentioned; experience primarily revolves around software engineering roles.   |
| Communication Skills                    | 8/10  | Good communication demonstrated in both resume and cover letter but could emphasize project management specifics more clearly. |
| Motivation & Alignment                  | 10/15 | Demonstrates enthusiasm for the role and a suitable background but lacks a clear linkage between previous experience and the desired project manager skills. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit          | 5/10  | Mention of DEI practices and team cohesion is noted, but further evidence of management practices in cultural contribution is desirable. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment     | 9/10  | Career trajectory reflects growth from technical roles into management, aligning with the expectations of this PM role. |

#### üßæ Summary
Edward Kemper presents a solid background in software engineering with significant leadership experience, but gaps exist in direct project management skills in Agile SDLC environments. While he showcases strong motivation and alignment with team dynamics and organizational fit, he lacks sufficient managerial experience specifically managing software development projects, which is crucial for this role. The technical skills presented show versatility, but adjustments to highlight suitable project management experience are needed.
