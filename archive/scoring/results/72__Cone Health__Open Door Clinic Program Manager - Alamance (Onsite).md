|----------------------------------|----------|------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25    | 25         | The candidate demonstrates a strong technical foundation, particularly in software engineering and project management. However, more emphasis on program management skills rather than solely software development would enhance this score. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20    | 20         | The candidate has relevant experience, particularly as a Technical Program Manager, but the construction project management role may not fully align with the tech-focused position sought. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 7/10     | 10         | The candidate understands core program management concepts and healthcare technology but lacks specific experience in the healthcare domain relevant to this role. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10     | 10         | Communication skills are effectively demonstrated in both the resume and cover letter. The mention of collaboration with cross-functional teams showcases the ability to convey complex information clearly. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15    | 15         | The candidate shows a genuine interest in the role and aligns their experiences with the organization's mission; however, a clearer connection to the specific challenges of the Open Door Clinic would be beneficial. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 6/10     | 10         | While the candidate articulates a people-centric approach, they need to demonstrate understanding of the culture within Cone Health more explicitly to fully align with their stated values. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 4/10   | 10         | The candidate's path shows a transition from engineering to program management; however, the shift could be more strongly articulated to showcase how it is aligned with the job's expectations. |
