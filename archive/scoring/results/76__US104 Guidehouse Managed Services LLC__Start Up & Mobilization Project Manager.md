| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|---------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 18/25 | The candidate has a strong technical background but leans heavily towards software engineering with limited explicit Technical Project Management (TPM) experience. Some key methodologies relevant to the TPM role are well-covered but may need more focus on project management tools and frameworks used. |
| Relevant Experience             | 15/20 | The experience as a Technical Project Manager at Kemper Systems LLC, and as a Senior Software Engineer mentions leadership but lacks emphasis on managing teams and TPM stakes which is required in the job description. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 6/10  | Limited knowledge of the healthcare revenue cycle, which is specifically mentioned in the job posting. The experience is diverse but needs to align more with the healthcare domain. |
| Communication Skills            | 8/10  | Communication skills are demonstrated well through team leadership and project reports. The cover letter presents strong narratives around collaboration. |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15 | The cover letter expresses a passion for program management but could more explicitly connect personal experiences to the organization‚Äôs values and goals. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 7/10  | The candidate shows understanding of organizational dynamics but could elaborate on adaptability in a hybrid work model and working with diverse teams. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 12/10 | Clear progression from engineering to project management, showcasing relevant skills for the TPM role. Relevant certification (PMP) in progress further adds to this. |
