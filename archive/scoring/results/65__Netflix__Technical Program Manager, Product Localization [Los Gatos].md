| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 7/10     | The candidate has a good understanding of team dynamics. However, a stronger emphasis on inclusion and diversity would resonate with the company's stated goals.                                                                                  |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 5/10     | The trajectory shows a transition from engineering roles into management, which is positive, but lacks necessary program management experience in a localization context at the required level for Netflix.                                                    |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a strong resume with significant experience in technical project and program management. His technical background is robust, particularly in software development and engineering management, making him a competent candidate for a TPM role. However, the gaps in specific localization experience and evident familiarity with industry-standard localization tools pose concerns in the context of Netflix's role. The applicant's communication and managerial skills are commendable; however, emphasizing more on relevant localization experience and an understanding of Netflix's culture and values could bolster his candidacy.
