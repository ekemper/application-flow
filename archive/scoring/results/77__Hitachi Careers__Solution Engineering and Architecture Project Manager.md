|---------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                | 20/25 | Edward has a strong technical background, particularly in software engineering. However, the role emphasizes solution engineering and architecture experience, which is less evident in his resume. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | Although Edward has substantial project management experience, his managerial experience is more related to software engineering rather than program management in complex, cross-functional environments as required in the job description. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 10/10 | Edward has relevant experience in technology and data solutions, which aligns well with the domain focus of the role. His background in software development and project management in tech contexts supports this. |
| Communication Skills             | 8/10  | Strong in articulating ideas and leading teams, as shown in leadership roles. Greater emphasis on client-facing communication skills in his descriptions would enhance this score. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15 | Edward‚Äôs cover letter shows genuine interest, particularly in aligning with the company's mission. However, a more explicit tie-in to the specific company's goals and how he could further them could enhance this. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10  | While he mentions leadership values, a more explicit connection to the company's emphasis on DEI and the specific cultural aspects mentioned in the job description is lacking. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 9/10  | His career trajectory shows a logical progression toward this project management role, with relevant experience. However, some roles appear more focused on technical execution rather than management. |
