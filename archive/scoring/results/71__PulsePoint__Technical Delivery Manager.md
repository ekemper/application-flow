#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper demonstrates considerable experience in both technical roles and project management. Their technical foundation is solid, with skills in various programming languages, but the emphasis is more skewed towards software engineering rather than project delivery management. The candidate's interest in healthcare technology aligns well with the company's mission, but their cover letter could better articulate fit with organizational values. The overall experience meets many of the job's demands, though e emphasis might better reflect project management accomplishments.
