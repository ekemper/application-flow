|----------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                       | 20/25   | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills through experience in software development and project management, but there could be a clearer emphasis on project management methodologies relevant to the role.                                                                 |
| Relevant Experience                    | 15/20   | Experience in software engineering roles is prevalent, but the candidate lacks extensive exposure to rail infrastructure projects, which could raise concerns given the specific domain focus required in the job description.                                               |
| Domain Knowledge                       | 5/10    | The candidate has delivered technology-focused projects but lacks direct experience in rail infrastructure, which is a primary focus of this position, leading to a deduction in this category.                                     |
| Communication Skills                   | 8/10    | Strong communication skills are evident through the cover letter and demonstrated experience managing teams; however, more focus on stakeholder interaction and report presentations in previous roles would strengthen this aspect. |
| Motivation & Alignment                 | 12/15   | The candidate shows enthusiasm for the role and aligns with the company values, especially mentioning their approach to leadership that fosters team cohesion and trust.                                        |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit         | 7/10    | The candidate mentions values that resonate with the organization‚Äôs culture, yet they could strengthen fit by discussing experiences that directly align with M&J‚Äôs values on teamwork and collaboration in infrastructure contexts.                              |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment     | 5/10    | There‚Äôs a clear career trajectory towards management roles; however, the pivot from a technical background to program management in an infrastructure domain is not strongly established, resulting in a lower score.       |
