#### üéØ Category Scores and Feedback

| Category                        | Score | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 18/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills relevant to software development and technical project management, with a broad exposure to relevant technologies. However, the resume leans heavily on software engineering rather than TPM-specific experience, leading to a below-average score in this category. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20 | The candidate has a solid history of leading projects, particularly in agile environments, but lacks explicit Customer Success Management experience required in the job description, which affects their fit for the role. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10  | While the candidate has experience in software engineering and project management, they lack specific experience in analytics tools stated in the job description (e.g., Power BI, Tableau). This limits their relevance to the role. |
| Communication Skills             | 9/10  | The cover letter and resume effectively communicate the candidate's leadership philosophy and experience in facilitating cross-team collaboration. Clear examples of successful projects enhance this score. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 10/15 | The candidate effectively expresses enthusiasm for the role, but it could be improved with a more direct linkage between past experiences and how they support Oracle's mission of customer success. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 6/10  | The application lacks strong examples connecting the candidate's values or practices with Oracle's cultural initiatives around inclusivity or community involvement, leading to a lower score. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 15/10  | The candidate shows a clear trajectory towards technical leadership, which aligns well with the principal role's requirements. |

However, he lacks direct experience in Customer Success Management and does not highlight the specific analytics experience sought by Oracle, which are notable gaps given the job requirements. While he articulates a strong motivation to contribute positively to Oracle, his alignment with the specific needs of the role could be improved.
