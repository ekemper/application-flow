#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a solid background in technical program management and software engineering. His technical skills are considerable, but he leans heavily towards software development rather than technical program management, which is less aligned with the role's requirements at Oracle. He has demonstrated effective communication and leadership, but his experience in managing complex cloud services needs strengthening. His enthusiasm for the role and alignment with its responsibilities are apparent and add to his candidacy.
