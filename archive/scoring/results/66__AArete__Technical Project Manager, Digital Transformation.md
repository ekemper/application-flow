|----------------------------------|--------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 18/25  | Edward has a robust technical skill set but lacks specific Salesforce experience essential for the role. The absence of Salesforce-related projects in his resume is a significant gap. |
| Relevant Experience              | 13/20  | Although he has extensive project management experience, he falls short of the 5+ years focused specifically on digital transformation and Salesforce implementations. His focus has been more on software engineering rather than project management in this specific tech domain.|
| Domain Knowledge                 | 6/10   | While his experience includes some project management and engineering, he does not demonstrate a strong understanding of Salesforce capabilities as required by the job description. |
| Communication Skills             | 9/10   | Edward's cover letter and resume articulate thoughts clearly and demonstrate strong communication skills, particularly in stakeholder management.  |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15  | His motivations are aligned with the company‚Äôs culture and mission, as shown in his cover letter, but he could emphasize his excitement for digital transformation more explicitly. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 6/10   | Edward's experience in leading teams and fostering collaboration aligns with AArete's values but lacks specific examples that demonstrate inclusion and team leadership in tech projects. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 2/10   | His trajectory toward technical project management is unclear; he has mostly held engineering roles, making it harder to assess his fit for a managerial position in this particular context. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper has a commendable background in software engineering and technical project management. His experience leading cross-functional teams and managing projects aligns well with general project management principles. However, his lack of specific experience with Salesforce implementation and digital transformation projects is concerning, especially given the role's requirements. Additionally, while his communication skills are strong, his career trajectory toward a technical project management role in the context of Salesforce and digital transformation lacks clarity.
