| Category                        | Score (Max Points) | Feedback |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|----------|
| Technical Skills                 | 20/25             | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills in software engineering and project management, but lacks direct experience with Microsoft IAM technologies specified in the role. The overlap with Microsoft technologies is minimal, which slightly hampers the score. |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20             | The candidate has relevant experience managing projects and teams, primarily in software engineering roles. However, the lack of specific experience with Microsoft infrastructure projects and transitions to Microsoft 365 impacts the score negatively. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10              | The candidate has experience in software engineering and some infrastructure projects but does not show concrete experience with identity management or Microsoft systems which are critical for this role. |
| Communication Skills             | 9/10              | Strong communication skills are evident, especially in the cover letter and descriptions of past leadership experiences. |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 12/15             | The candidate shows alignment with the role and exhibits enthusiasm for infrastructure projects, but could articulate more directly how their goals align with Sangoma‚Äôs objectives. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 9/10              | The emphasis on collaboration and servant leadership aligns well with the company's values as expressed in the job description. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 3/10              | The candidate hasn't transitioned completely into a project management role focused on infrastructure, leading to a lower score. Previous roles heavily lean on software engineering instead of project management. |

#### üßæ Summary

The candidate has a robust background in software engineering and project management.

Communication skills are a strong point, and there is alignment with the cultural values of the organization, but overall readiness for this specific role is hindered by domain-specific experience.
