#### üßæ Summary

Overall, Edward Kemper is a strong candidate for technical program management with 11 years of experience in software and project management. His background in the tech industry and leadership experience positions him well. However, the lack of direct experience in AI/ML security and specific security protocols raises concerns about his fit for this particular role, which focuses heavily on security practices tied to AI/ML technologies. His communication skills are solid, and he effectively aligns with CZI's values but could improve his articulation of relevant experience related to security.
