|--------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills               | 20/25     | Edward demonstrates strong technical expertise with a breadth of skills in software development and technical program management. However, the experience with specific technologies directly related to automotive applications or similar domains crucial for the role isn't highlighted enough to meet outlined requirements.                                                                |
| Relevant Experience              | 15/20     | The candidate has over 11 years in technical roles but lacks the specified 5+ years in technical program management directly tied with software engineering teams. The experience with managing cross-functional teams also shows potential, but the candidate hasn‚Äôt sufficiently articulated their program management responsibilities in alignment with the job requirements. |
| Domain Knowledge                 | 5/10      | There is limited domain knowledge in the automotive sector specified in the resume and cover letter compared to the requirements stated. Although the candidate's experience is in various tech domains, a direct connection to automotive services is missing, which may be crucial for this role.                                                     |
| Communication Skills             | 9/10      | Excellent verbal and written communication skills are showcased. The cover letter effectively outlines collaboration and leadership experience while maintaining a professional tone.                                                                                                        |
| Motivation & Alignment           | 8/15      | The cover letter shows enthusiasm and an understanding of Amazon's mission but lacks depth in how the candidate's goals align with the specific role at Amazon Auto. More explicit motivations relating to the automotive industry would strengthen alignment.                                                                            |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit   | 5/10      | The cover letter touches on an inclusive culture. However, more examples demonstrating fitting into Amazon's fast-paced and innovative culture would enhance this category.                                                                                                                |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 8/10      | Edward's career trajectory aligns closely with program and project management, showcasing leadership in various technical capacities. Some roles focus heavily on software engineering, lacking explicit mention of program management duties that resonate with the role's requirements.                                               |
