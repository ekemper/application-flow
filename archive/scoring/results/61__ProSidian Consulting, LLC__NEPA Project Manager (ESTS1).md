|------------------------------------|-------|----------|
| Technical Skills                   | 18/25 | The candidate demonstrates a solid range of technical skills, particularly in software engineering and project management methodologies. However, emphasis on software engineering over TPM experience limits the score. |
| Relevant Experience                  | 12/20 | The experience aligns somewhat with the role; however, the candidate does not highlight significant involvement in environmental analysis or documentation as required. The recent experience appears more focused on software engineering rather than NEPA-specific project management. |

| Communication Skills                | 7/10  | The candidate‚Äôs cover letter conveys strong communication, but some specifics on stakeholder interactions could enhance this rating. |
| Motivation & Alignment              | 8/15  | The motivation for transitioning from a software engineering role to a project manager in environmental services is not clearly articulated, reducing alignment with the job‚Äôs focus. |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit      | 6/10  | The applicant highlights teamwork and leadership skills, but lacks specific examples relevant to the culture of ProSidian Consulting which values curiosity and humility. |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment  | 6/10  | The candidate's career history shows a linear trajectory in software engineering and project management, but a clearer connection to environmental services is needed. |

#### üßæ Summary

Edward Kemper presents a strong technical background with extensive experience in software engineering and project management. Key strengths lie in leading teams and communicating with stakeholders, yet gaps in direct environmental analysis experience hinder his fit for the NEPA Project Manager role. The transitional narrative from software engineering to environmental project management lacks clarity, which may raise concerns for hiring managers assessing alignment with the company's needs.
