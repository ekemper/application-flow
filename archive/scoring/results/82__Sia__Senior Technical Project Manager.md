|----------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                       | 20/25 | The candidate demonstrates strong technical skills, particularly in software engineering and API development. However, the role requires more emphasis on project management tools like Service Now or similar, which the candidate lacks.                       |
| Relevant Experience                    | 18/20 | The candidate has extensive experience as a Technical Program Manager, managing cross-functional teams and delivering projects on time. The recent experience in software engineering is pertinent but should highlight more PM-specific responsibilities. |
| Domain Knowledge                       | 8/10  | Good domain knowledge with relevant sector experience. The blend between software engineering and program management is clear, though more examples from directly related industry experience would strengthen this further.                            |
| Communication Skills                   | 9/10  | The cover letter and resume effectively demonstrate strong communication skills. The guidance in managing status and updates to stakeholders showcases this capacity well.                                                                                |
| Motivation & Alignment                 | 12/15 | The candidate appropriately expresses enthusiasm for the role and aligns with the company's values. However, specific references to the job's mission could enhance this section.                                                                              |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit         | 7/10  | While the candidate shows good values of collaboration and leadership, the resume does not explicitly match the company's core values such as Entrepreneurial spirit and Care & Support, which could indicate a misalignment in organizational fit.         |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment     | 8/10  | The candidate‚Äôs trajectory from engineering roles to project management shows clear development. Still, more emphasis on leadership and outcome metrics for PM roles could improve perceived alignment with the job requirements.                              |
