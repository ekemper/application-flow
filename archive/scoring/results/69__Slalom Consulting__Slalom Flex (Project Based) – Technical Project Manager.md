|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Technical Skills                | 20/25  | Edward showcases a robust array of technical skills pertinent to project management and engineering. However, he can better highlight direct project management methodologies such as Agile or Waterfall. |
| Relevant Experience             | 13/20  | While he has significant software engineering experience, his direct experience as a technical project manager lacks depth, particularly in consulting and complex project management. |
| Domain Knowledge                | 8/10   | Edward has varied experience in technical environments, although additional explicit mention of consulting experience specific to the targeted role may enhance this score.                       |
| Communication Skills            | 8/10   | The candidate's cover letter reflects strong written communication skills. However, specific examples of presentations to executive levels could strengthen his case.                             |
| Motivation & Alignment          | 10/15  | His motivations resonate with the consulting domain. However, a stronger emphasis on alignment with Slalom‚Äôs consulting focus and values could enhance this aspect.                                  |
| Cultural or Organizational Fit  | 7/10   | While Edward expresses a passion for collaborative environments, more specific references to team culture and shared values connected to Slalom could enhance this score.                           |
| Career Trajectory & Role Alignment | 3/10  | His background is more rooted in software engineering than project management, which may raise concerns about suitability for a pure project management role as outlined.                          |

#### üßæ Summary
Overall, Edward presents a strong technical foundation with substantial engineering experience, which positions him well for roles requiring a technical perspective. Still, his direct experience in technical project management, particularly within a consulting context, is less emphasized, which is a potential gap. He effectively communicates his experiences and goals but could benefit from aligning his narrative more closely with the consulting aspects of the position with Slalom.
