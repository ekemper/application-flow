## Example 1

I am excited to express my interest in the Technical Project Manager role with Heartflow. I believe I have the right combination of deep technical experience and leadership experience to make a positive impact.

As a leader, I believe in practicing radical candor by providing and receiving honest feedback with empathy and respect. As a team lead at StoryBlocks, I maintained focus on fostering psychological safety such that radical candor was the norm. In this environment, everyone on the team was excited to ideate and contribute thoughtfully to discussions. The result was a highly aligned and motivated group of people that were eager to solve difficult problems and hold each other accountable to high standards. I aim to facilitate this type of culture in my next role.

At StoryBlocks, I led a multiphase effort to create an enterprise free trial subscription workflow for our sales team to use with prospects. Each phase was validated by measured customer interactions and qualitative reports from SDR sales calls to assess its effectiveness. Throughout the project I interfaced with folks from design and product roles as well as the commercial sales team to develop specifications for technical deliverables, user experience flows, and OKRs / KPIs for the project. The technical deliverables required new API endpoints, new and updated database models, new customer-facing workflows, and instrumentation for analytics and observability. The ROI for the project was a more effective sales cycle and faster times to close for B2B contracts worth upwards of $50K.

Early in my career, I formed an LLC to service engineering contracts for a company that designs materials for aerospace applications. My role was to design and implement engineering processes for measuring the electrodynamic properties of the materials under strict compliance requirements. I developed a true sense of ownership with this role. I was responsible for the engineering work, managing customer-facing business processes, and everything in between. The work I did was critical to their product development lifecycle and enabled the delivery of several projects that totaled in value over $500K.

In sum, I will bring over a decade of experience in engineering, technical leadership, and scientific computing to the table. I have a proven track record of leading engineering efforts that generate customer value, while maintaining continuous focus on improvement of technical and social processes.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to speaking with you.

**Cheers,**

## Example 4

Dear \_\_\_ Hiring Team,

I’m excited to apply for the Technical Program Manager role supporting the **\_**. With 11+ years of experience delivering high-impact technical initiatives across engineering, product, and marketing teams, I bring a strong track record of aligning strategy with execution—especially in ambiguous, growth-focused environments.

I’m particularly inspired by Pinterest’s mission to help people create a life they love, and I’m eager to contribute to the systems that connect new users to that value.

At Storyblocks, I led a cross-functional initiative to develop an enterprise free trial platform, collaborating with sales, product, and engineering stakeholders to define milestones, manage technical risk, and deploy at scale. This effort directly accelerated our B2B sales cycle, shortening time-to-close for contracts exceeding $50K.

Earlier, at HelpTile, I co-founded and engineered a SaaS platform where I implemented end-to-end telemetry and user engagement analytics to support data-driven product development—experience that aligns well with Pinterest’s emphasis on SEO and campaign tooling.

I thrive in environments that require systems thinking, clear communication, and leadership without authority. I’ve led agile ceremonies, implemented change management processes, and guided technical audits—consistently fostering transparency, trust, and velocity across teams. Whether I’m driving roadmap execution, building new processes, or resolving cross-team dependencies, I bring both a proactive mindset and deep technical fluency that enable me to translate complexity into action.

Pinterest’s mission to inspire people and help them create a life they love deeply resonates with me. I believe in building technology that empowers and uplifts, and I’m excited by the opportunity to contribute to a platform that’s a positive, creative corner of the internet. The chance to help new users discover that value—and to do so while growing alongside a team that values innovation, empathy, and impact—would be incredibly meaningful.

I’d be thrilled to bring my technical leadership and cross-functional program experience to support that vision.

Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.
