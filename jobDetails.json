        "description": "The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded by Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in 2015 to help solve some of society's toughest challenges \u2014 from eradicating disease and improving education to addressing the needs of our local communities. Our mission is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone.\n\nThe Team\n\nAcross our work in Science, Education, and within our communities, we pair technology with grantmaking, impact investing, and collaboration to help accelerate the pace of progress toward our mission. Our Central Operations & Partners team provides the support needed to push this work forward. Central Operations & Partners consists of our Brand & Communications, Community, Facilities, Finance, Infrastructure/IT Operations/Business Systems, Initiative Operations, People, Real Estate/Workplace/Facilities/Security, Research & Learning, and Ventures teams. These teams provide the essential operations, services, and strategies needed to support CZI's progress toward achieving its mission to build a better future for everyone.\n\nOur Central Tech team provides technology and security support for CZI and our grantees. Engineering, IT, and Security are most effective when in sync and learning from each other daily. Across our three pillars of Infrastructure, Security, and Grantee & Partner Support, we enable our teams to achieve their goals faster and more securely. We leverage technology to automate manual processes, constantly innovate to optimize operations, provide first-class support, and build solutions to enable the scale and execution of our business partners' strategies and initiatives.\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nAs we engage directly in our communities, we must work from a shared place of trust. We know that our communities care deeply about how information is collected, used, and shared, and so do we. So when CZI builds products, supports grantees, makes venture investments, and purchases services from third parties, we consider their privacy and security at every step.\n\nWe're seeking a Principal Technical Program Manager who will play a key role in priority enterprise-level initiatives, influence security across our organization, and drive implementing our Information Security strategy. We are looking for a TPM with a proven track record of developing and shipping high-quality technologies and services and integrating them into products and experiences. This role will have the opportunity to work closely with Software Engineers, Scientists, Educators, Infrastructure Engineers, Product Experience members, and leaders across the organization. The role will help evolve a security program focused on enabling CZI staff while protecting sensitive information in an active and robust environment and adhering to security measures applied to the production infrastructure (e.g. architecture, authentication, data usage policies).\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\u2022 Lead the charge: Drive the strategy and execution of CZI's AI/ML security program, ensuring alignment with organizational goals and compliance requirements.\n\u2022 Empower a team: Lead and mentor a talented team of Product and AI Security professionals.\n\u2022 Champion secure AI: Collaborate with AI/ML teams to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate security risks throughout the AI lifecycle (model training, data usage, inference).\n\u2022 Build a security-first culture: Partner with engineering and product teams to integrate security best practices into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), including threat modeling, vulnerability management, and secure design reviews.\n\u2022 Be a trusted advisor: Serve as the go-to security expert for AI and product development teams, providing guidance and support on all security-related matters.\n\u2022 Drive innovation: Develop and implement cutting-edge strategies to address AI-specific security challenges, such as adversarial attacks, model robustness, and data integrity.\n\u2022 Communicate effectively: Clearly articulate complex technical concepts to diverse audiences, including engineers, product managers, legal and compliance teams, and leadership.\n\nWhat You'll Bring\n\u2022 Deep security expertise: 10+ years of experience in Security-focused Technical Program Management, plus a strong background in Software Engineering, Systems Engineering, or System Architecture.\n\u2022 AI/ML security proficiency: Proven experience working on AI/ML security, with a strong understanding of AI/ML technologies, architectures, and related security risks.\n\u2022 Leadership and mentorship: Demonstrated ability to lead and mentor a team of technical security professionals.\n\u2022 Security champion: A passion for security and a deep understanding of secure development practices, threat modeling, and risk management.\n\u2022 Broad security knowledge: Strong understanding of Information Security principles, including security architecture, authentication, encryption, and data protection.\n\u2022 Compliance awareness: Familiarity with relevant regulatory frameworks and their application to AI systems and products.\n\u2022 Excellent communication skills: Ability to effectively communicate technical concepts to diverse audiences and build strong relationships with stakeholders.\n\nCompensation\n\nThe Redwood City, CA base pay range for this role is $200,000.00 - $300,000.00. New hires are typically hired into the lower portion of the range, enabling employee growth in the range over time. Actual placement in range is based on job-related skills and experience, as evaluated throughout the interview process.\n\nBenefits for the Whole You\n\nWe're thankful to have an incredible team behind our work. To honor their commitment, we offer a wide range of benefits to support the people who make all we do possible.\n\u2022 CZI provides a generous 100% match on employee 401(k) contributions to support planning for the future.\n\u2022 Annual funding for employees that can be used most meaningfully for them and their families, such as housing, student loan repayment, childcare, commuter costs, or other life needs.\n\u2022 CZI Life of Service Gifts are awarded to employees to \"live the mission\" and support the causes closest to them.\n\u2022 Paid time off to volunteer at an organization of your choice.\n\u2022 Funding for select family-forming benefits.\n\u2022 Relocation support for employees who need assistance moving to the Bay Area\n\u2022 And more!\n\nIf you're interested in a role but your previous experience doesn't perfectly align with each qualification in the job description, we still encourage you to apply as you may be the perfect fit for this or another role.\n\nExplore our work modes, benefits, and interview process at www.chanzuckerberg.com/careers.\n\n#LI-Hybrid",

Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training.
